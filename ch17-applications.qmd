# Applications of Genomics and Proteomics

## Transforming the World

Genomics and proteomics aren't just academic subjects—they're changing our world in practical ways every day!

## Medicine and Diagnostics

### Personalized Medicine

**Traditional medicine**: One-size-fits-all approach
**Personalized medicine**: Treatment tailored to YOUR genes!

**How it works**:

- Sequence your genome

- Identify genetic variants

- Predict disease risks

- Choose best treatments for YOU

**Examples**:

**1. Cancer Treatment**:

- Sequence tumor DNA

- Find specific mutations

- Choose drugs targeting those exact mutations

- Example: Herceptin for HER2-positive breast cancer

**2. Pharmacogenomics**:

- Your genes affect how you process drugs

- Some people metabolize drugs quickly, some slowly

- Genetic testing chooses right dose for YOU

- Avoid dangerous reactions!

**Example - Warfarin dosing**:

- Blood thinner with narrow safe range

- Genes affect proper dose (3-fold variation!)

- Genetic test determines your safe dose

- Prevents bleeding or clotting

**3. Rare Disease Diagnosis**:

- Many rare diseases have genetic causes

- Whole genome sequencing finds mutations

- Often ends "diagnostic odyssey"

- Enables treatment or management

**Success story**:

- Child with mysterious illness

- Years of tests, no diagnosis

- Genome sequencing finds rare mutation

- Diagnosis leads to treatment

- Child improves!

### Early Disease Detection

**Finding diseases before symptoms appear**:

**1. Cancer Screening**:

- BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations → high breast/ovarian cancer risk

- Early screening saves lives

- Preventive surgery option

**2. Liquid Biopsies**:

- Test blood for cancer DNA

- Catch cancer very early

- Monitor treatment response

- Detect recurrence

**3. Carrier Screening**:

- Before having children, test if you carry disease genes

- Cystic fibrosis, sickle cell, Tay-Sachs, many others

- Informed reproductive choices

**4. Newborn Screening**:

- Test babies for genetic conditions

- Early treatment prevents problems

- Example: PKU (phenylketonuria) - special diet prevents brain damage

### Understanding Disease Mechanisms

**Genomics reveals HOW diseases work**:

**Alzheimer's Disease**:

- Multiple genes involved

- APP, PSEN1, PSEN2 cause early-onset forms

- APOE4 increases late-onset risk

- Understanding guides drug development

**Diabetes**:

- Type 1: Autoimmune (some genetic risk factors)

- Type 2: Complex, many genes involved

- Monogenic diabetes: Single gene mutations (different treatment!)

**Heart Disease**:

- Familial hypercholesterolemia: LDLR gene mutations

- Very high cholesterol from birth

- Gene therapy in development!

## Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology

### Making Useful Products

**Using organisms as factories**:

### 1. Therapeutic Proteins

- Now made in bacteria with human insulin gene!

- Cheaper, safer, unlimited supply

**Other examples**:

- Growth hormone

- Clotting factors for hemophilia

- Antibodies for cancer/autoimmune diseases

- Vaccines (hepatitis B, HPV)

**How it's done**:

1. Insert human gene into bacteria/yeast

2. Bacteria make human protein

3. Purify protein

4. Give to patients!

### 2. Industrial Enzymes

**Laundry Detergent**:

- Contains enzymes that break down stains

- Engineered for better performance

**Food Processing**:

- Cheese making (rennet)

- Brewing (specialized yeasts)

- Sweeteners (high-fructose corn syrup)

**Biofuels**:

- Engineer microbes to make ethanol, biodiesel

- From agricultural waste

- Renewable energy source!

### 3. Synthetic Biology

**Designing organisms from scratch**:

**Craig Venter's Synthetic Genome**:

- First synthetic self-replicating cell (2010)

- Designed genome on computer

- Built it from chemicals

- Worked!

**Applications**:

- Bacteria that produce biofuels

- Organisms that clean up pollution

- Microbes that make medicines

- Programmable cells

**Artemisinin production**:

- Anti-malaria drug

- Traditionally from plant (expensive!)

- Engineered yeast to produce it

- Cheaper medicine saves lives!

## Agriculture and Food

### Feeding the World

**Genomics improves crops and livestock**:

### Crop Improvement

**1. Disease Resistance**:

- Identify resistance genes

- Breed disease-resistant varieties

- Reduces pesticide use

- More sustainable

**2. Drought Tolerance**:

- Find genes for drought resistance

- Important for climate change

- Crops survive with less water

**3. Nutritional Enhancement**:

- **Golden Rice**: Engineered with vitamin A

- Prevents blindness in developing countries

- **Biofortification**: More iron, zinc, etc.

**4. Better Yields**:

- Genomics accelerates breeding

- Select best plants faster

- Feed growing population

**5. Longer Shelf Life**:

- Tomatoes that don't spoil quickly

- Reduces food waste

### Livestock Genomics

**Breeding better animals**:

- Disease resistance

- Better meat/milk production

- Animal welfare

- Efficiency (less environmental impact)

**Example - Dairy Cows**:

- Genomic selection for milk production

- Healthier cows

- Higher efficiency

### Precision Agriculture

**Using genomics with technology**:

- Sequence soil microbes

- Understand plant-microbe interactions
