# Metagenomics and the Microbiome

## Studying Communities of Microbes

### What Is Metagenomics?

**Metagenomics** = Studying genetic material from environmental samples containing MANY different species

**Meta** = beyond or among
**Genomics** = studying genomes

So: Studying the genomes of entire communities at once!

Think of it like:
- Analyzing a whole forest instead of one tree
- Studying a city instead of one person
- Reading all books in a library at once

### The Microbiome

**Microbiome** = All the microorganisms living in a particular environment

**Examples**:
- **Human gut microbiome**: Trillions of bacteria in your intestines
- **Soil microbiome**: Microbes in dirt
- **Ocean microbiome**: Microbes in seawater
- **Skin microbiome**: Bacteria on your skin

**Key fact**: There are more bacterial cells in/on you than human cells!
- ~30 trillion human cells
- ~40 trillion bacterial cells
- You're more microbe than human (by cell count)!

## Why Study Microbiomes?

### They're Everywhere and Important!

**In your body**:
- Help digest food
- Make vitamins (K, B12)
- Train immune system
- Protect from pathogens
- Affect mood and behavior!

**In the environment**:
- Decompose dead material
- Fix nitrogen (make fertilizer)
- Clean up pollution
- Cycle nutrients
- Produce oxygen (ocean microbes!)

**Without microbes**: Life on Earth would collapse!

## The Challenge: Unculturable Microbes

### Most Microbes Can't Be Grown in Lab

**The problem**:
- Traditional microbiology: Grow bacteria on plates
- But 99% of environmental microbes won't grow in lab!
- Called "unculturable"

**Why they won't grow**:
- Need specific conditions
- Grow too slowly
- Depend on other microbes
- Unknown nutritional needs

**Result**: We were missing most microbial diversity!

### The Solution: Culture-Independent Methods

**Metagenomics breakthrough**:
- Don't need to grow them!
- Extract DNA directly from environment
- Sequence all DNA together
- Identify all microbes present

**It's like**:
- Instead of inviting each person to interview
- Reading everyone's ID cards at once
- Getting census data without asking questions

## How Metagenomics Works

### The Workflow

**1. Sample Collection**
- Collect environmental sample
- Soil, water, feces, skin swab, etc.
- Contains billions of microbes

**2. DNA Extraction**
- Break open all cells
- Extract all DNA
- Mix of DNA from thousands of species!

**3. Sequencing**
- Sequence all DNA fragments
- Millions of reads
- Don't know which species each fragment comes from (yet!)

**4. Analysis**
- Identify which microbes are present
- How many of each?
- What genes do they have?
- What can they do?

### Two Main Approaches

**16S rRNA Sequencing** (targeted):
- Sequence only 16S rRNA gene
- Present in all bacteria
- Like a bacterial barcode
- Tells you WHO is there
- Cheap and fast!

**Shotgun Metagenomics** (whole genome):
- Sequence ALL DNA
- More expensive
- Tells you WHO is there AND what they can do
- Functional information

## The Human Microbiome

### We're Walking Ecosystems!

**Where microbes live on/in you**:
- **Gut** (most abundant): 100 trillion bacteria
- **Skin**: Different microbes on different body parts
- **Mouth**: Hundreds of species
- **Nose**: Unique communities
- **Vagina**: Dominated by Lactobacillus (usually)

**It's personal**: Everyone has unique microbiome!
- Like a fingerprint
- Affected by diet, genetics, environment, medications

### The Gut Microbiome

**Most studied and important**

**Major bacterial groups** (phyla):
- **Firmicutes** (40-60%)
- **Bacteroidetes** (20-40%)
- **Actinobacteria** (smaller %)
- **Proteobacteria** (smaller %)
- Plus archaea, fungi, viruses!

**What they do**:

**1. Digest Food**:
- Break down complex carbohydrates we can't digest
- Fiber, resistant starch
- Produce short-chain fatty acids (healthy!)

**2. Make Vitamins**:
- Vitamin K (blood clotting)
- B vitamins (B12, biotin, folate)
- We couldn't make these without microbes!

**3. Train Immune System**:
- Teach immune cells friend vs. foe
- Without microbes: Allergies, autoimmune diseases
- "Old friends" hypothesis

**4. Protect from Pathogens**:
- Occupy space (no room for bad guys)
- Produce antimicrobial compounds
- Compete for resources

**5. Produce Neurotransmitters**:
- Serotonin (mood)
- GABA (calming)
- Dopamine
- "Gut-brain axis"!

### Dysbiosis: When Microbiome Goes Wrong

**Dysbiosis** = Imbalanced microbiome

**Associated with**:
- Obesity
- Type 2 diabetes
- Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
- Allergies
- Autism (controversial)
- Depression and anxiety
- Autoimmune diseases

**Causes of dysbiosis**:
- **Antibiotics** (kill good bacteria too!)
- Poor diet (low fiber)
- Stress
- Lack of sleep
- C-section birth (miss mom's microbes)
- Formula feeding (vs. breastfeeding)

## Environmental Metagenomics

### Soil Microbiome

**Incredibly diverse**:
- Teaspoon of soil: 1 billion bacteria
- Thousands of different species
- More diversity than gut!

**What they do**:
- Decompose organic matter
- Cycle nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus)
- Help plants grow
- Carbon storage (climate change!)

**Applications**:
- Agriculture (healthy soil = healthy crops)
- Bioremediation (clean up pollution)
- Carbon sequestration

### Ocean Microbiome

**Craig Venter's Global Ocean Sampling**:
- Sailed around world
- Sampled ocean microbes
- Discovered MILLIONS of new genes!

**Cyanobacteria** (like Prochlorococcus):
- Most abundant photosynthesizer on Earth!
- Produce 20% of Earth's oxygen
- Tiny but critically important

**Marine microbes**:
- Base of food chain
- Carbon cycling
- Climate regulation
- Chemical diversity (drug discovery!)
