# Experimental Proofs and Methods

## How Scientists Prove Things in Genomics

### The Scientific Method in Action

Throughout this book, we've learned about amazing discoveries. But how did scientists actually PROVE their ideas?

**The scientific method**:
1. Observe something interesting
2. Ask a question
3. Form a hypothesis (educated guess)
4. Design an experiment to test it
5. Collect and analyze data
6. Draw conclusions

Let's explore clever experimental methods that proved key concepts!

## Classic Labeling Experiments

### Using Isotopes to Track Molecules

**Isotopes** = Different forms of the same element
- Same element, different weight
- Some are radioactive (can be detected!)
- Used to "label" and track molecules

Think of isotopes like:
- Putting a GPS tracker on something
- Using glow-in-the-dark paint to follow it
- Tagging an animal to track its migration

### The Meselson-Stahl Experiment (1958)

**The Question**: How does DNA replicate? Three possibilities:
1. **Conservative**: Original DNA stays together, new copy is separate
2. **Semi-conservative**: Each new DNA has one old strand, one new strand
3. **Dispersive**: Old and new DNA mixed together

**The Clever Experiment**:

**Setup**:
- Grew bacteria in medium with heavy nitrogen (¹⁵N) for many generations
- All DNA became "heavy"
- Then switched to normal nitrogen (¹⁴N)
- Let bacteria replicate once, twice, etc.

**Detection Method**:
- Centrifuge in special solution
- Heavy DNA sinks more
- Light DNA floats more
- Can see distinct bands!

**Results**:
- After 1 replication: ALL DNA was medium weight (half-heavy, half-light)
- After 2 replications: Half medium, half light
- This matched semi-conservative replication!

**Conclusion**: DNA replication is **semi-conservative**!
- Each new DNA has one original strand and one new strand
- Like unzipping the ladder and building a new side for each half

**Why this experiment was brilliant**:
- Simple, elegant design
- Clear, unambiguous results
- Definitively answered the question

### Pulse-Chase Experiments

**What they are**: Give cells a "pulse" of labeled material, then "chase" with unlabeled material

**How it works**:
1. **Pulse**: Give cells radioactive amino acids for short time
2. **Chase**: Switch to normal amino acids
3. **Track**: See where the radioactive proteins go over time

**What it tells us**:
- Path of proteins through the cell
- How long processes take
- Where proteins end up

**Example**: Tracking protein secretion
- Pulse: Radioactive amino acids → proteins made in ER
- Chase: Follow labeled proteins through Golgi → secretion
- Result: Map the secretory pathway!

## Functional Genomics Approaches

### Understanding What Genes Do

**Functional genomics** = Determining the functions of genes and their products

### Gene Knockout Experiments

**What it is**: Deliberately "break" a gene to see what happens

**Logic**:
- If you break gene X and the organism can't do Y anymore
- Then gene X must be needed for Y!

**Methods**:

**1. Classical Gene Knockout** (in mice):
- Remove or disrupt a gene
- Create mice with that gene missing
- See what goes wrong
- Identify gene function!

**Example**:
- Knock out gene for leptin
- Mice become obese
- Conclusion: Leptin controls appetite/weight!

**2. RNA Interference (RNAi)**:
- Add small RNAs that destroy specific mRNAs
- Temporarily "turn off" genes
- See effects
- Faster than classical knockout

**3. CRISPR-Cas9** (modern method):
- Precisely edit genes
- Can knockout, knockin, or modify
- Fast, cheap, accurate
- Revolutionary!

### Gene Overexpression

**What it is**: Make cells produce too much of a protein

**Methods**:
- Insert extra copies of gene
- Use strong promoters
- Force high expression

**Why do it**:
- See effects of too much protein
- Study protein function
- Produce proteins for research or medicine

**Example**:
- Overexpress growth factor
- Cells grow faster
- Conclusion: That growth factor promotes growth!

### Reporter Genes

**What they are**: Genes that make easily detectable proteins

**Common reporters**:
- **GFP** (Green Fluorescent Protein): Glows green!
- **Luciferase**: Makes light (like fireflies)
- **LacZ**: Turns blue with specific chemical

**How to use them**:
1. Attach reporter gene to gene of interest
2. Reporter expression shows where/when gene is active
3. Can see it with microscope or other detection!

**Example**:
- Attach GFP to muscle gene promoter
- See which cells become muscle (they glow green!)
- Watch development in real-time!

Think of reporters like:
- Putting a light bulb on a light switch
- You can see when the switch (gene) is ON!

## ChIP: Chromatin Immunoprecipitation

### Finding Where Proteins Bind to DNA

**ChIP** = Method to find where specific proteins bind on DNA

**How it works**:
1. **Crosslink**: Proteins bound to DNA are "glued" together
2. **Break up**: Shear DNA into small pieces
3. **Immunoprecipitate**: Use antibody to pull out specific protein
4. **Unglue**: Reverse crosslinking
5. **Sequence**: Sequence the DNA that was bound
6. **Map**: Find where in genome that DNA came from!

**Result**: Know exactly where in the genome your protein was bound!

**Applications**:
- Find where transcription factors bind
- Map histone modifications
- Understand gene regulation

**ChIP-seq** = ChIP + Next-gen sequencing
- Maps protein-DNA interactions genome-wide
- Incredibly powerful!

## CRISPR-Cas9: The Gene Editing Revolution

### Molecular Scissors for DNA

**CRISPR-Cas9** = Precise gene editing tool (Nobel Prize 2020!)

**What it does**: Cut DNA at exact locations and make changes

**How it works**:
1. **Guide RNA**: Designed to match target DNA sequence
2. **Cas9 enzyme**: Molecular scissors that cut DNA
3. **Complex**: Guide RNA + Cas9 finds target
4. **Cut**: Cas9 cuts both DNA strands
5. **Repair**: Cell repairs cut (can insert changes during repair!)

Think of it like:
- **Find**: GPS directs you to exact address (guide RNA)
- **Cut**: Scissors cut at that location (Cas9)
- **Fix**: Cell repairs, possibly with changes

**Applications**:

**Research**:
- Knockout genes easily
- Edit specific mutations
- Study gene function

**Medicine** (experimental):
- Fix disease-causing mutations
- Sickle cell disease trials
- Cancer immunotherapy
- Potentially cure genetic diseases!

**Agriculture**:
- Create disease-resistant crops
- Improve nutrition
- Drought tolerance

**Why CRISPR is revolutionary**:
- **Easy**: Much simpler than old methods
- **Fast**: Days instead of months/years
- **Cheap**: Affordable for most labs
- **Precise**: Target exact locations
- **Versatile**: Works in many organisms

## Single-Cell Technologies

### Single-Cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq)

**What it does**: Measure gene expression in individual cells

**Why it matters**:

**Example - watching protein movement**:
- Tag protein with GFP (green fluorescent protein)
- Watch it move in living cells

- Like having a spy camera in the cell!

### FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization)

**What it does**: Find specific DNA or RNA sequences in cells/tissues

**How it works**:
1. Design fluorescent probe that binds specific sequence
