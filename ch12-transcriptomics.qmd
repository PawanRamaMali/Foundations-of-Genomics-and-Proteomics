# Transcriptomics

## Beyond the Genome: The Transcriptome

### What Is the Transcriptome?

If the **genome** is all your DNA, the **transcriptome** is all the RNA being made in your cells right now!

Think of it like:

- **Genome** = Your complete cookbook (all possible recipes)

- **Transcriptome** = The recipes you're actually using today

The transcriptome changes:

- Between different cell types (brain vs. muscle)

- At different times (morning vs. evening)

- In different conditions (healthy vs. sick)

**Transcriptomics** is the study of all RNA molecules in a cell or organism.

## The Three Main Types of RNA

### 1. mRNA (Messenger RNA)

**What it does**: Carries the recipe from DNA to ribosomes

**Think of it like**: A photocopy of a recipe that goes to the kitchen

**Key facts**:

- Temporary (breaks down quickly)

- Only about 1-5% of total RNA

- Codes for proteins

- Each mRNA corresponds to one gene (in eukaryotes)

**Process**:

1. Transcribed from DNA in the nucleus

2. Processed (capping, poly-A tail, splicing)

3. Travels to cytoplasm

4. Read by ribosomes to make protein

5. Eventually degrades

### 2. tRNA (Transfer RNA)

**What it does**: Brings amino acids to the ribosome during protein synthesis

**Think of it like**: Delivery trucks bringing ingredients to the kitchen

**Key facts**:

- Cloverleaf shape (looks like a three-leaf clover when flat)

- 3D L-shape structure

- About 15% of total RNA

- Each tRNA carries one specific amino acid

- Has an "anticodon" that matches mRNA codons

**How it works**:

1. tRNA picks up its specific amino acid

2. Recognizes the matching codon on mRNA

3. Delivers amino acid to growing protein chain

4. Detaches and goes back for another amino acid

There are different tRNAs for each of the 20 amino acids!

### 3. rRNA (Ribosomal RNA)

**What it does**: Forms the structure of ribosomes (protein-making factories)

**Think of it like**: The factory building itself

**Key facts**:

- About 80% of total RNA! (Most abundant)

- Combines with proteins to form ribosomes

- Does NOT code for proteins

- Actually catalyzes protein synthesis (it's an enzyme!)

- Very ancient and conserved across all life

**Structure**:

- Humans have 4 types of rRNA

- Combine with ~80 ribosomal proteins

- Form large and small ribosomal subunits

## RNA Processing in Eukaryotes

### From Pre-mRNA to Mature mRNA

In eukaryotes, RNA goes through major changes before it's ready! The initial RNA copy is called **pre-mRNA** (precursor mRNA).

### 1. 5' Capping

**What happens**: A special "cap" is added to the beginning (5' end) of the RNA

**The cap**:

- A modified guanine nucleotide

- Added immediately after transcription starts

- Like putting a protective cap on a pen

**Why it matters**:

- Protects mRNA from degradation

- Helps ribosome recognize and bind to mRNA

- Helps transport mRNA out of nucleus

### 2. 3' Poly-A Tail

**What happens**: A long tail of adenine (A) nucleotides is added to the end (3' end)

**The tail**:

- About 200-250 adenines in a row (AAAAAAAA...)

- Added after transcription finishes

- Like a protective tail

**Why it matters**:

- Protects mRNA from degradation

- Helps export mRNA from nucleus

- Helps ribosomes find and bind mRNA

- Longer tail = longer mRNA lifespan

### 3. Splicing: Removing Introns

**What happens**: Introns (non-coding regions) are cut out, exons (coding regions) are joined together

**The process**:

1. Pre-mRNA contains both introns and exons

2. **Spliceosome** (molecular machine) recognizes intron-exon boundaries

3. Cuts out introns

4. Joins exons together

5. Introns are degraded

Think of it like:

- Filming a movie (transcription)

- Editing out unwanted scenes (splicing)

- Final cut ready for theaters (mature mRNA)!

## Alternative Splicing: One Gene, Many Proteins!

### The Amazing Discovery

Here's where things get really interesting! **One gene can make multiple different proteins** through alternative splicing!

### How Alternative Splicing Works

Instead of always joining exons in the same order, cells can:

- **Skip exons**: Leave some exons out

- **Include or exclude exons**: Sometimes include, sometimes exclude

- **Use alternative splice sites**: Cut at different positions

- **Retain introns**: Sometimes keep an intron in

Think of it like:

- You have LEGO bricks numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

- You could build: 1-2-3-4-5 OR 1-3-4-5 OR 1-2-4-5 OR 1-2-3-5

- Same bricks, different combinations, different structures!

### Why Alternative Splicing Is Powerful

**Creates protein diversity**:

- Humans have ~20,000 genes

- But make ~100,000+ different proteins!

- Alternative splicing explains this!

**Examples**:

- **DSCAM gene** (in fruit flies): Can make 38,000 different proteins from ONE gene!

- **Human titin gene**: Makes different versions in different muscle types

- **Antibody genes**: Create diverse antibodies through splicing

**Allows fine-tuned regulation**:

- Different tissues can make different protein versions

- Respond to different conditions

- Create proteins with slightly different functions

### Regulation of Alternative Splicing

Special proteins called **splicing factors** control which exons are included:

- Some promote exon inclusion

- Some promote exon skipping

- Different cells have different splicing factors

- Responds to signals (hormones, stress, development)

## Non-Coding RNAs

### RNA That Doesn't Make Protein

We used to think all important RNA coded for proteins. We were wrong!

**Many RNAs have functions without making proteins**:

### microRNAs (miRNAs)

**What they are**: Tiny RNAs (about 22 nucleotides long)

**What they do**: Regulate gene expression by:

- Binding to mRNA

- Blocking translation OR

- Causing mRNA degradation

**Impact**:

- One miRNA can regulate hundreds of different genes!

- Important for development, cell division, disease

- Dysregulation linked to cancer

Think of them like: Volume controls that turn down gene expression

### Long Non-Coding RNAs (lncRNAs)

**What they are**: Long RNA molecules (>200 nucleotides) that don't code for protein

**What they do**: Many different functions:

- Regulate gene expression

- Organize chromatin

- Guide proteins to specific DNA locations

- Some functions still unknown!

**Impact**:

- More common than expected (thousands in humans!)

- Important for development and disease

- Active area of research

### Other Functional RNAs

- **snRNAs**: Small nuclear RNAs (part of the spliceosome!)

- **snoRNAs**: Small nucleolar RNAs (modify other RNAs)

- **Ribozymes**: RNA molecules that act as enzymes

- **siRNAs**: Small interfering RNAs (used in research and medicine)

## Studying the Transcriptome

### Why Study the Transcriptome?

**Understanding gene expression**:

- Which genes are turned on in different cells?

- How does gene expression change in disease?

- How do cells respond to signals?

**Better than studying genome alone**:

- Genome is the same in all cells

- But transcriptome differs between cells!

- Tells you what's actually happening

### RNA Sequencing (RNA-seq)

**Modern method** to study the transcriptome:

**How it works**:

1. Extract all RNA from cells

2. Convert RNA to DNA (more stable)

3. Sequence the DNA

4. Count how many copies of each RNA

5. Determine which genes are active

**What we learn**:

- Which genes are expressed

- How much each gene is expressed

- Which splice variants are made

- Discovery of new RNAs

### Applications

**Medicine**:

- Diagnose diseases by RNA patterns

- Predict treatment response

- Find new drug targets

- Understand cancer

**Development**:

- How embryos develop

- Cell differentiation

- Tissue formation

**Evolution**:

- Compare gene expression across species

- Understand how expression patterns evolved
