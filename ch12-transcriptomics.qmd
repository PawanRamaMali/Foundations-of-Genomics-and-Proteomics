# Transcriptomics

## Beyond the Genome: The Transcriptome

### What Is the Transcriptome?

If the **genome** is all your DNA, the **transcriptome** is all the RNA being made in your cells right now!

Think of it like:

- **Genome** = Your complete cookbook (all possible recipes)

- **Transcriptome** = The recipes you're actually using today

The transcriptome changes:

- Between different cell types (brain vs. muscle)

- At different times (morning vs. evening)

- In different conditions (healthy vs. sick)

**Transcriptomics** is the study of all RNA molecules in a cell or organism.

## The Three Main Types of RNA

### 1. mRNA (Messenger RNA)

**What it does**: Carries the recipe from DNA to ribosomes

**Think of it like**: A photocopy of a recipe that goes to the kitchen

**Key facts**:

- Temporary (breaks down quickly)

- Only about 1-5% of total RNA

- Codes for proteins

- Each mRNA corresponds to one gene (in eukaryotes)

**Process**:

1. Transcribed from DNA in the nucleus

2. Processed (capping, poly-A tail, splicing)

3. Travels to cytoplasm

4. Read by ribosomes to make protein

5. Eventually degrades

### 2. tRNA (Transfer RNA)

**What it does**: Brings amino acids to the ribosome during protein synthesis

**Think of it like**: Delivery trucks bringing ingredients to the kitchen

**Key facts**:

- Cloverleaf shape (looks like a three-leaf clover when flat)

- 3D L-shape structure

- About 15% of total RNA

- Each tRNA carries one specific amino acid

- Has an "anticodon" that matches mRNA codons

**How it works**:

1. tRNA picks up its specific amino acid

2. Recognizes the matching codon on mRNA

3. Delivers amino acid to growing protein chain

4. Detaches and goes back for another amino acid

There are different tRNAs for each of the 20 amino acids!

### 3. rRNA (Ribosomal RNA)

**What it does**: Forms the structure of ribosomes (protein-making factories)

**Think of it like**: The factory building itself

**Key facts**:

- About 80% of total RNA! (Most abundant)

- Combines with proteins to form ribosomes

- Does NOT code for proteins

- Actually catalyzes protein synthesis (it's an enzyme!)

- Very ancient and conserved across all life

**Structure**:

- Humans have 4 types of rRNA

- Combine with ~80 ribosomal proteins

- Form large and small ribosomal subunits

## RNA Processing in Eukaryotes

### From Pre-mRNA to Mature mRNA

In eukaryotes, RNA goes through major changes before it's ready! The initial RNA copy is called **pre-mRNA** (precursor mRNA).

### 1. 5' Capping

**What happens**: A special "cap" is added to the beginning (5' end) of the RNA

**The cap**:

- A modified guanine nucleotide

- Added immediately after transcription starts

- Like putting a protective cap on a pen

**Why it matters**:

- Protects mRNA from degradation

- Helps ribosome recognize and bind to mRNA

- Helps transport mRNA out of nucleus

### 2. 3' Poly-A Tail

**What happens**: A long tail of adenine (A) nucleotides is added to the end (3' end)

**The tail**:

- About 200-250 adenines in a row (AAAAAAAA...)

- Added after transcription finishes

- Like a protective tail

**Why it matters**:

- Protects mRNA from degradation

- Helps export mRNA from nucleus

- Helps ribosomes find and bind mRNA

- Longer tail = longer mRNA lifespan

### 3. Splicing: Removing Introns

**What happens**: Introns (non-coding regions) are cut out, exons (coding regions) are joined together

**The process**:

1. Pre-mRNA contains both introns and exons

2. **Spliceosome** (molecular machine) recognizes intron-exon boundaries

3. Cuts out introns

4. Joins exons together

5. Introns are degraded

Think of it like:

- Filming a movie (transcription)

- Editing out unwanted scenes (splicing)

- Final cut ready for theaters (mature mRNA)!

## Alternative Splicing: One Gene, Many Proteins!

### The Amazing Discovery

Here's where things get really interesting! **One gene can make multiple different proteins** through alternative splicing!

### How Alternative Splicing Works

Instead of always joining exons in the same order, cells can:

- **Skip exons**: Leave some exons out

- **Include or exclude exons**: Sometimes include, sometimes exclude

- **Use alternative splice sites**: Cut at different positions

- **Retain introns**: Sometimes keep an intron in

Think of it like:

- You have LEGO bricks numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

- You could build: 1-2-3-4-5 OR 1-3-4-5 OR 1-2-4-5 OR 1-2-3-5

- Same bricks, different combinations, different structures!

### Why Alternative Splicing Is Powerful

**Creates protein diversity**:

- Humans have ~20,000 genes

- But make ~100,000+ different proteins!

- Alternative splicing explains this!

**Examples**:

- **DSCAM gene** (in fruit flies): Can make 38,000 different proteins from ONE gene!

- **Human titin gene**: Makes different versions in different muscle types

- **Antibody genes**: Create diverse antibodies through splicing

**Allows fine-tuned regulation**:

- Different tissues can make different protein versions

- Respond to different conditions

- Create proteins with slightly different functions

### Regulation of Alternative Splicing

Special proteins called **splicing factors** control which exons are included:

- Some promote exon inclusion

- Some promote exon skipping

- Different cells have different splicing factors

- Responds to signals (hormones, stress, development)

## Non-Coding RNAs

### RNA That Doesn't Make Protein

We used to think all important RNA coded for proteins. We were wrong!

**Many RNAs have functions without making proteins**:

### microRNAs (miRNAs)

**What they are**: Tiny RNAs (about 22 nucleotides long)

**What they do**: Regulate gene expression by:

- Binding to mRNA

- Blocking translation OR

- Causing mRNA degradation

**Impact**:

- One miRNA can regulate hundreds of different genes!

- Important for development, cell division, disease

- Dysregulation linked to cancer

Think of them like: Volume controls that turn down gene expression

### Long Non-Coding RNAs (lncRNAs)

**What they are**: Long RNA molecules (>200 nucleotides) that don't code for protein

**What they do**: Many different functions:

- Regulate gene expression

- Organize chromatin

- Guide proteins to specific DNA locations

- Some functions still unknown!

**Impact**:

- More common than expected (thousands in humans!)

- Important for development and disease

- Active area of research

### Other Functional RNAs

- **snRNAs**: Small nuclear RNAs (part of the spliceosome!)

- **snoRNAs**: Small nucleolar RNAs (modify other RNAs)

- **Ribozymes**: RNA molecules that act as enzymes

- **siRNAs**: Small interfering RNAs (used in research and medicine)

## Studying the Transcriptome

### Why Study the Transcriptome?

**Understanding gene expression**:

- Which genes are turned on in different cells?

- How does gene expression change in disease?

- How do cells respond to signals?

**Better than studying genome alone**:

- Genome is the same in all cells

- But transcriptome differs between cells!

- Tells you what's actually happening

### Why RNA is Unstable (And Why We Convert to cDNA)

Before we discuss methods to study RNA, we need to understand an important challenge: **RNA is extremely unstable**!

**The problem with RNA**:

- **Chemically unstable**: RNA has an extra -OH group at the 2' position
  - This makes RNA reactive and prone to breaking
  - DNA is more stable (no 2'-OH group)

- **RNases everywhere**: Enzymes that degrade RNA (RNases) are literally everywhere!
  - On your skin
  - In the air
  - In cells (lots of them!)
  - Very stable and hard to inactivate

**Why so many RNases? An evolutionary defense!**

This is actually evolution being clever:

- **Viral defense**: Many viruses have RNA genomes
- **Immune system**: Our cells have RNases to destroy viral RNA
- **Quality control**: Cells need to degrade old or damaged RNA quickly
- **Gene regulation**: Controlling RNA degradation = controlling gene expression

Think of it like:

- Your body treats all external RNA as potentially dangerous
- RNases are like security guards everywhere
- They destroy RNA before it can cause problems
- Unfortunately, this makes working with RNA experimentally very difficult!

**The solution: Convert RNA to cDNA**

**cDNA** = Complementary DNA (DNA copy of RNA)

**Why cDNA is better**:

- **Stable**: DNA is chemically stable (no 2'-OH group)
- **RNase-resistant**: RNases only cut RNA, not DNA
- **Can be amplified**: Use PCR to make many copies
- **Easier to work with**: Standard DNA techniques apply
- **Long-term storage**: Can store cDNA for years

**How RNA â†’ cDNA conversion works**:

1. Extract RNA from cells (work quickly, keep everything cold!)
2. Add **reverse transcriptase** enzyme (from retroviruses)
   - This special enzyme makes DNA from RNA template
   - Regular DNA polymerase cannot do this!
3. Add primers (usually oligo-dT primers that bind to poly-A tail)
4. Reverse transcriptase synthesizes DNA copy of RNA
5. Now you have stable cDNA to work with!

Think of it like:

- RNA = fragile ice sculpture (melts quickly)
- cDNA = photograph of the ice sculpture (stable, permanent)
- You can't keep the ice sculpture, but the photo preserves the information!

### DNA Microarrays: Measuring Gene Expression

Before NGS sequencing became popular, scientists used **microarrays** to measure gene expression [@schena1995quantitative; @shalon1996dna]. Microarrays are still used today for certain applications!

#### What Is a DNA Microarray?

A **DNA microarray** is like a gene expression chip:

- Glass slide (like a microscope slide)
- Thousands of spots, each containing DNA probes for one gene
- Measures expression of thousands of genes simultaneously!

Think of it like:

- Each spot = a fishing hook for one specific gene
- Different colored fish = RNA from different samples
- Count how many fish each hook catches = measure gene expression!

#### How Microarrays Work

**Step 1: Create the array**

- Synthesize or print short DNA sequences (probes) onto glass slide
- Each spot contains probes for one specific gene
- Can have 10,000-50,000+ spots on one slide!
- Each probe is complementary to a specific mRNA

**Step 2: Prepare samples**

1. Extract RNA from cells (e.g., normal cells vs. cancer cells)
2. Convert RNA to cDNA using reverse transcriptase
   - Why? RNA is unstable!
   - cDNA is much more stable and easier to work with
3. Label cDNA with fluorescent dyes
   - **Normal cells**: Label with green dye (Cy3)
   - **Cancer cells**: Label with red dye (Cy5)

**Step 3: Hybridization**

- Mix both labeled cDNA samples together
- Apply to microarray slide
- Incubate (allow cDNA to bind to matching probes)
- Wash away unbound cDNA

**Step 4: Scan and analyze**

- Scan slide with laser
  - Green laser detects Cy3 (normal sample)
  - Red laser detects Cy5 (cancer sample)
- Camera captures fluorescent signals
- Computer measures intensity at each spot

#### Interpreting Microarray Colors

**Two-color microarray results**:

- **Green spot**: Gene higher in normal sample
- **Red spot**: Gene higher in cancer sample
- **Yellow spot**: Gene equal in both samples (red + green = yellow)
- **Black/dark spot**: Gene not expressed in either sample

**Example interpretation**:

```
Spot Color    â†’ Meaning
â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
Red           â†’ Gene upregulated in disease
Green         â†’ Gene downregulated in disease
Yellow        â†’ No change in expression
Black         â†’ Gene not expressed
```

**Quantitative data**:

- Actually, you get **two intensity values** per spot:
  - Green intensity (Cy3)
  - Red intensity (Cy5)
- Calculate ratio: Red/Green
  - Ratio > 1 = upregulated in cancer
  - Ratio < 1 = downregulated in cancer
  - Ratio â‰ˆ 1 = no change

#### Single-Color vs. Two-Color Microarrays

**Two-color microarrays**:

- Compare two samples directly on same array
- Use two fluorescent dyes (e.g., Cy3 and Cy5)
- Measures **relative** differences
- Good for comparing disease vs. normal

**Single-color microarrays** (e.g., Affymetrix):

- One sample per array, one dye
- Measure absolute intensity for each sample separately
- Compare results across multiple arrays
- Better for comparing many samples

#### Microarray Applications

**Gene expression profiling**:

- Compare disease vs. healthy tissue
- Identify disease biomarkers
- Classify cancer subtypes

**Drug response**:

- Which genes change when drug is added?
- Predict drug efficacy
- Identify drug targets

**Developmental biology**:

- How does gene expression change during development?
- Track changes over time

**Example - Cancer classification**:

1. Extract RNA from tumor sample
2. Convert to cDNA, label with fluorescent dye
3. Hybridize to microarray
4. Compare expression pattern to database
5. Classify tumor type based on gene expression profile!

#### Limitations of Microarrays

**Prior knowledge required**:

- Can only detect genes you put probes for
- Cannot discover new genes or transcripts
- Limited to known sequences

**Relative quantification only**:

- Measures relative differences (fold-change)
- Cannot tell absolute number of RNA molecules
- Limited dynamic range

**Background noise**:

- Non-specific binding creates noise
- Cross-hybridization between similar sequences

**Limited sensitivity**:

- Hard to detect low-abundance transcripts
- Saturation at high expression levels

#### Microarrays vs. RNA-seq

| Feature | Microarray | RNA-seq |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Prior knowledge** | Required | Not required |
| **New transcripts** | Cannot detect | Can discover |
| **Quantification** | Relative | Absolute possible |
| **Dynamic range** | Limited (~3 orders) | Wide (~5 orders) |
| **Cost** | Lower for targeted | Lower for discovery |
| **Sensitivity** | Moderate | High |
| **Applications** | Known genes, routine | Discovery, novel transcripts |

**When to use microarrays**:

- Focused gene expression studies
- Routine clinical diagnostics
- Cost-effective for specific gene panels
- Comparing expression of known genes

**When to use RNA-seq**:

- Discovering new transcripts
- Detecting splice variants
- Measuring absolute expression levels
- Studying organisms without reference genome
