# Metabolomics and the Metabolome

## The Chemistry of Life

### What Is Metabolomics?

**Metabolomics** = Study of all small molecules (metabolites) in a biological system

**Metabolites** = Small molecules involved in metabolism:

- Sugars (glucose, fructose)

- Amino acids (building blocks of proteins)

- Lipids (fats)

- Nucleotides (building blocks of DNA/RNA)

- Vitamins

- Hormones

- And thousands more!

Think of it like:

- Genome = The cookbook

- Transcriptome = The recipes being read

- Proteome = The chefs and kitchen tools

- **Metabolome** = The actual food and ingredients!

### The "Ome" Family

**Comparing the omes**:

| Ome | What | How Many | Timescale |
|-----|------|----------|-----------|
| **Genome** | DNA | ~20,000 genes | Stable (lifetime) |
| **Transcriptome** | RNA | ~100,000 transcripts | Hours |
| **Proteome** | Proteins | ~1 million forms | Hours to days |
| **Metabolome** | Small molecules | ~20,000+ metabolites | Seconds to minutes |

**Key insight**: Metabolome is the FASTEST changing!

- Responds immediately to changes

- Reflects what's happening RIGHT NOW

- Real-time snapshot of cell state

## Why Study the Metabolome?

### The Endpoint of Biology

**The metabolome is where the action is**:

- Genes can be present but inactive

- RNA can be made but not translated

- Proteins can be made but not active

- **Metabolites** = actual work being done!

**Example**:

- Gene for insulin → might be present

- mRNA for insulin → might be made

- Insulin protein → might be produced

- **Blood glucose level** → shows if insulin WORKING

**Phenotype** (what we see) is determined by metabolites!

### Health and Disease

**Metabolites reflect health status**:

- **Diabetes**: High blood glucose

- **Kidney disease**: High creatinine

- **Heart disease**: Abnormal cholesterol

- **Cancer**: Altered metabolism

**Biomarkers**:

- Metabolites that indicate disease

- Used for diagnosis

- Monitor treatment

- Predict outcomes

### Personalized Medicine

**Pharmacometabolomics**:

- How drugs affect your metabolism

- Predict drug responses

- Avoid side effects

- Optimize dosing

**Everyone metabolizes differently**:

- Genetics

- Microbiome

- Diet

- Lifestyle

## The Metabolome

### How Many Metabolites?

**Estimated numbers**:

- **Human metabolome**: ~110,000+ metabolites

- **Plant metabolome**: Even more! (>200,000)

- **Microbial metabolome**: Highly variable

**Much more complex than genome**:

- Same atoms, different arrangements

- Isomers (same formula, different structure)

- Chemical diversity is huge!

### Types of Metabolites

**Primary metabolites**:

- Essential for life

- Present in all organisms

- Amino acids, sugars, nucleotides

- Conserved across species

**Secondary metabolites**:

- Not essential for survival

- Organism-specific

- Defense, signaling, communication

- Plants are champions (colors, scents, toxins!)

## How Metabolomics Works

### The Challenge

**Unlike genes**:

- Metabolites are chemically diverse

- Different sizes, properties

- Water-loving (hydrophilic) vs. fat-loving (hydrophobic)

- Can't use one method to detect all!

### Analytical Techniques

**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS)**

**What it does**: Measures mass of molecules

**How it works**:

1. Ionize metabolites (give them a charge)

2. Separate by mass-to-charge ratio

3. Detect ions

4. Identify based on mass

**Why it's good**:

- Very sensitive

- Can identify unknown metabolites

- High-throughput

**Coupled with chromatography**:

- **LC-MS** (Liquid Chromatography-MS): Separate first, then measure

- **GC-MS** (Gas Chromatography-MS): For volatile metabolites

**2. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)**

**What it does**: Uses magnets to identify molecules

**How it works**:

- Put sample in strong magnetic field

- Radio waves excite atoms

- Atoms emit signals

- Pattern reveals molecular structure

**Why it's good**:

- Non-destructive

- Quantitative

- Less sample preparation

- Can identify unknown structures

**Why it's limited**:

- Less sensitive than MS

- Expensive equipment

- Need lots of sample

### Workflow

**1. Sample Collection**

- Blood, urine, tissue, cells

- Time-sensitive (metabolites change quickly!)

- Immediate freezing often needed

**2. Sample Preparation**

- Extract metabolites

- Different methods for different types

- Remove proteins and other interfering molecules

**3. Analysis**

- Run on MS or NMR

- Generate data

**4. Data Processing**

- Identify peaks

- Match to known metabolites

- Quantify amounts

**5. Data Analysis**

- Statistical analysis

- Find differences between groups

- Pathway analysis

## Metabolic Pathways

### Networks of Chemical Reactions

**Metabolic pathway** = Series of chemical reactions converting one molecule to another

**Example - Glycolysis**:

- Glucose → Pyruvate

- 10 enzymatic steps

- Produces energy (ATP)

- Happens in all cells!

### Major Pathways

**Energy metabolism**:

- **Glycolysis**: Break down glucose

- **TCA cycle** (Krebs cycle): Generate energy
