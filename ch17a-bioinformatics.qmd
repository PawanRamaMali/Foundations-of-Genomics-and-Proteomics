# Bioinformatics and Computational Biology

## When Biology Meets Computers

### What Is Bioinformatics?

**Bioinformatics** = Using computers and math to understand biological data

Think of it like:
- Using a calculator instead of counting by hand
- Using GPS instead of paper maps
- Using Google instead of encyclopedia

But for:
- DNA sequences
- Protein structures
- Gene expression data
- Evolutionary relationships

### Why We Need Bioinformatics

**The big data problem**:
- Human genome: 3 billion letters
- Would take 95 years to read out loud!
- Can't analyze by hand
- Need computers!

**Modern biology generates MASSIVE data**:
- One sequencing run: Billions of DNA letters
- Gene expression study: Thousands of genes
- Proteomics experiment: Thousands of proteins
- Too much for humans alone

**Solution**: Bioinformatics!

## The Data Explosion

### How Much Data?

**Human Genome Project (1990-2003)**:
- 13 years to sequence one genome
- 3 billion base pairs
- Cost: $3 billion

**Today (2025)**:
- Sequence genome in 1-2 days
- Cost: <$1,000
- Thousands sequenced per day!

**Result**: Exponentially growing data!

**Genomic data is now BIGGER than**:
- YouTube
- Twitter
- Astronomy

We're drowning in biological data - bioinformatics is the life raft!

## Core Bioinformatics Tasks

- ORF (Open Reading Frame) prediction

**Sequence Alignment**:
- Comparing two or more sequences
- Finding similarities and differences
- Identifying conserved regions

**Example**:
```
Sequence 1: ATCGATCGATCG
Sequence 2: ATCG--CGATCG
            **** ***** (matches)
```

**Motif Finding**:
- Searching for patterns
- Transcription factor binding sites
- Protein domains
- Regulatory elements

### 2. Genome Assembly

**The puzzle problem**:

2. Find overlapping regions
3. Merge overlaps to build longer sequences
4. Repeat until whole genome assembled

**Challenges**:

- **Combined approaches** (best!)

### 4. Variant Calling

**What it is**: Finding differences between genomes

**Why it matters**:
- Disease-causing mutations

**Process**:
1. Sequence individual's genome
2. Compare to reference genome
3. Identify differences (SNPs, indels, etc.)
4. Annotate variants (what genes affected?)
5. Predict impact (harmful, benign, unknown?)

### 5. Gene Expression Analysis

**What it is**: Measuring which genes are active

**RNA-seq analysis**:
1. Sequence all RNA in sample
2. Count reads for each gene
3. Normalize data
4. Compare conditions (healthy vs. diseased)
5. Find differentially expressed genes

**Challenges**:

- **BLASTX**: DNA vs. Protein (translates DNA first)

**Example use**:
- Found unknown gene in organism
- BLAST against database
- Find it matches insulin in mice
- Probably insulin in your organism too!

### Pairwise Alignment

**Comparing two sequences**:

**Global alignment** (Needleman-Wunsch):
- Align entire sequences end-to-end
- Best for similar-length, similar sequences

**Local alignment** (Smith-Waterman):
- Find best matching regions
- Don't need to align everything
- BLAST uses this approach!

### Multiple Sequence Alignment
