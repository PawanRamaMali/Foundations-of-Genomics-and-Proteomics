# Bioinformatics and Computational Biology

## When Biology Meets Computers

### What Is Bioinformatics?

**Bioinformatics** = Using computers and math to understand biological data

Think of it like:

- Using a calculator instead of counting by hand

- Using GPS instead of paper maps

- Using Google instead of encyclopedia

But for:

- DNA sequences

- Protein structures

- Gene expression data

- Evolutionary relationships

### Why We Need Bioinformatics

**The big data problem**:

- Human genome: 3 billion letters

- Would take 95 years to read out loud!

- Can't analyze by hand

- Need computers!

**Modern biology generates MASSIVE data**:

- One sequencing run: Billions of DNA letters

- Gene expression study: Thousands of genes

- Proteomics experiment: Thousands of proteins

- Too much for humans alone

**Solution**: Bioinformatics!

## The Data Explosion

### How Much Data?

**Human Genome Project (1990-2003)**:

- 13 years to sequence one genome

- 3 billion base pairs

- Cost: $3 billion

**Today (2025)**:

- Sequence genome in 1-2 days

- Cost: <$1,000

- Thousands sequenced per day!

**Result**: Exponentially growing data!

**Genomic data is now BIGGER than**:

- YouTube

- Twitter

- Astronomy

We're drowning in biological data - bioinformatics is the life raft!

## Core Bioinformatics Tasks

### 1. Sequence Analysis

**What it is**: Analyzing DNA, RNA, or protein sequences

**Common tasks**:

**Finding Genes**:

- Where are genes in a genome?

- Start and stop codons

- Splicing signals

- ORF (Open Reading Frame) prediction

**Sequence Alignment**:

- Comparing two or more sequences

- Finding similarities and differences

- Identifying conserved regions

**Example**:

```
Sequence 1: ATCGATCGATCG
Sequence 2: ATCG--CGATCG
            **** ***** (matches)
```

```

```
```

**Motif Finding**:

- Searching for patterns

- Transcription factor binding sites

- Protein domains

- Regulatory elements

### 2. Genome Assembly

**The puzzle problem**:

- Sequencing breaks DNA into millions of pieces

- Like a jigsaw puzzle with billions of pieces!

- Computer assembles them back together

**How it works**:

1. Sequence millions of short DNA fragments

2. Find overlapping regions

3. Merge overlaps to build longer sequences

4. Repeat until whole genome assembled

**Challenges**:

- Repetitive sequences (same piece fits many places!)

- Sequencing errors

- Huge computational requirements

**Modern solutions**:

- Better algorithms

- Long-read sequencing helps

- Multiple technologies combined

### 3. Gene Annotation

**What it is**: Assigning biological meaning to raw genome sequences

Think of it this way:

- **Sequencing** gives you the letters (A, T, G, C)

- **Annotation** gives you the words and their meanings

- Like having a book in a foreign language vs. a translated, annotated edition!

#### Why Annotation Matters

**The problem**:

- Raw genome sequence = billions of letters

- Which parts are genes?

- What do those genes do?

- Where are regulatory elements?

- Without annotation, genome is just meaningless data!

**The solution**: Genome annotation!

**Real-world importance**:

- Disease gene identification

- Drug target discovery

- Understanding evolution

- Personalized medicine

- Agricultural improvements

#### Dynamic Nature of Annotation

**Annotations are constantly updated!**

**Human genome builds** (versions):

- **HG18** (2006) - NCBI Build 36

- **HG19** (2009) - GRCh37 - Used for ~10 years

- **HG38** (2013-present) - GRCh38 - Current standard

- Future builds coming as we learn more!

**What changes between builds?**

- Better sequence assembly

- New genes discovered

- Gene boundaries refined

- Regulatory elements added

- Errors corrected

**Amazing fact**: ~25% of human gene annotations have been modified in the last 2 years!

**Why so many updates?**

- New experimental data (RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, etc.)

- Better computational methods

- Improved understanding of biology

- Discovery of new regulatory mechanisms

**Practical implication**: Always note which genome build you're using in research!

#### Types of Annotation

There are **two main types** of annotation:

### Structural Annotation

**Definition**: Identifying the physical structure of genomic features

**What it identifies**:

**1. Protein-Coding Genes**:

- Gene boundaries (start and end)

- Exon locations

- Intron locations

- 5' UTR and 3' UTR

- Splice sites

- Start codon (ATG) and stop codons

**2. RNA Genes**:

- tRNA genes

- rRNA genes

- miRNA genes

- lncRNA genes

- snRNA, snoRNA genes

**3. Regulatory Regions**:

- Promoters (transcription start sites)

- Enhancers

- Silencers

- Transcription factor binding sites

- CpG islands

**4. Repetitive Elements**:

- **SINEs** (Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements)

  - Alu elements in humans

  - ~10% of human genome!

- **LINEs** (Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements)

  - LINE-1 elements

  - ~17% of human genome!

- **LTRs** (Long Terminal Repeats)

  - From ancient retroviruses

- **Tandem repeats**

  - Satellites, microsatellites

- **Transposons** ("jumping genes")

  - DNA transposons

  - Can move around genome!

**5. Other Features**:

- Pseudogenes (dead gene copies)

- Centromeres

- Telomeres

- Origins of replication

### Functional Annotation

**Definition**: Predicting the biological function of genomic features

**What it predicts**:

**1. Protein Function**:

- What does this protein do?

- What pathway is it in?

- What cellular process?

- Based on sequence similarity to known proteins

**2. Protein Domains**:

- Functional modules in proteins

- DNA-binding domains

- Kinase domains

- Membrane-spanning domains

- Use databases like Pfam, InterPro

**3. Gene Ontology (GO) Terms**:

- Standardized vocabulary for gene function

- Three categories:

  - **Biological Process** (e.g., "DNA repair")

  - **Molecular Function** (e.g., "ATP binding")

  - **Cellular Component** (e.g., "nucleus")

- We'll explore GO in detail in the next section!

**4. Pathway Assignment**:

- Which metabolic pathway?

- Which signaling pathway?

- Use databases like KEGG, Reactome

**5. Disease Association**:

- Is gene linked to diseases?

- What mutations cause disease?

- Use databases like OMIM, ClinVar

**Example**:
```

```

```

```
Structural annotation:
Gene: BRCA1
Location: Chromosome 17
Exons: 24
Length: 81,189 bp

Functional annotation:
Function: DNA repair, tumor suppressor
Domains: RING finger, BRCT domains
Pathway: Homologous recombination
Disease: Breast and ovarian cancer when mutated
GO terms: DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoint
```

```

```
```

#### Gene Prediction Approaches

How do computers find genes in raw DNA sequence? There are **three main approaches**:

### 1. Ab Initio Prediction (Pattern-Based)

**"Ab initio" means "from the beginning"** - no external reference needed!

**How it works**:

- Uses statistical models to recognize gene patterns

- Looks for gene "signals" in DNA sequence

- Purely computational - no comparison to other genomes

**What it looks for**:

**Gene Signals**:

- **Start codon**: ATG (marks where translation begins)

- **Stop codons**: TAA, TAG, TGA (marks where translation ends)

- **Splice sites**: GT...AG boundaries (intron-exon junctions)

- **Promoter elements**: TATA box, CAAT box

- **Poly-A signals**: AATAAA (marks mRNA end)

**Statistical Features**:

- **Open Reading Frames (ORFs)**: Long stretches without stop codons

- **Codon bias**: Organisms prefer certain codons (explained below!)

- **GC content**: Coding regions often have different GC% than non-coding

- **Periodicity**: Coding sequences show 3-base-pair periodicity

#### Understanding Codon Bias

**What is codon bias?**

**The genetic code is redundant**:

- 64 possible codons (4³ nucleotides)

- Only 20 amino acids + 3 stop codons

- Most amino acids have multiple codons (synonymous codons)

**Example - Leucine** has 6 codons:
```

```

```

```
UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, CUG → All code for Leucine
```

```

```
```

**Codon bias** = Non-random usage of synonymous codons

**Organisms prefer certain codons over others!**

**Example**:
```

```

```

```
E. coli prefers:

- UUG for Leucine (used 50% of the time)

- UUA for Leucine (used 10% of the time)

Even though both code for same amino acid!
```

```

```
```

**Why codon bias exists?**

**1. tRNA Availability**:

- Cells have different amounts of each tRNA

- Preferred codons match abundant tRNAs

- Faster translation

- Higher expression

**2. Translation Efficiency**:

- Rare codons slow down translation

- Can cause ribosome stalling

- Affects protein folding

**3. mRNA Stability**:

- Certain codon patterns affect mRNA structure

- Influences half-life

**Codon Adaptation Index (CAI)**:

- Measure of codon bias (0 to 1)

- 1.0 = Uses only preferred codons

- 0.2 = Uses rare codons

- Highly expressed genes have CAI ~0.8-1.0

**Species-specific patterns**:

| Organism | GC Content | Preferred Codons |
|----------|------------|------------------|
| E. coli | ~50% | G/C at 3rd position |
| Yeast | ~40% | A/T at 3rd position |
| Human | ~40-45% | Variable by isochore |
| Plasmodium (malaria) | ~20% | Extremely A/T rich |

**Using codon bias in gene prediction**:

**Coding regions**:

- Show strong codon bias

- Match organism's preference

- Higher CAI score

**Non-coding regions**:

- Random codon usage

- No bias pattern

- Lower CAI score

**Ab initio gene finders use this**:
```

```

```

```
Sequence with high CAI → Likely coding
Sequence with low CAI → Likely non-coding
```

```

```
```

**Practical application - Recombinant Protein Production**:

**Problem**: Express human gene in E. coli

- Human uses different codons than E. coli

- Gene has rare E. coli codons

- Low expression!

**Solution**: Codon optimization

- Replace human codons with E. coli preferred codons

- Same protein sequence

- 10-1000x higher expression!

**Example**:
```

```

```

```
Human gene: ...UUA-CUA-UUA... (rare in E. coli)
Optimized:  ...UUG-CUG-UUG... (preferred in E. coli)
Same protein, better expression!
```

```

```
```

#### ORF Detection Algorithm (Detailed)

**The computational method** to find ORFs:

**Step-by-step algorithm**:

**1. Consider all 6 reading frames**:

- **3 frames on forward strand** (+1, +2, +3)

- **3 frames on reverse complement** (-1, -2, -3)

**Example DNA sequence**:
```

```

```

```
Forward: 5'-ATGCATGGATAA-3'

Reading frame +1: ATG CAT GGA TAA (start...stop) ← ORF!
Reading frame +2: A TGC ATG GAT AA
Reading frame +3: AT GCA TGG ATA A

Reverse complement: 3'-TACGTACCTATTT-5' = 5'-TTATAGGTACGTA-3'

Reading frame -1: TTA TAG GTA CGT A
Reading frame -2: T TAT AGG TAC GTA
Reading frame -3: TT ATA GGT ACG TA
```

```

```
```

**2. Scan for start codons (ATG)**:

- Mark all ATG positions in each frame

- Each is potential ORF start

**3. Extend until stop codon**:

- Read triplets from ATG

- Continue until TAA, TAG, or TGA

- This is one ORF

**4. Calculate ORF length**:

- Count nucleotides from start to stop

- Divide by 3 = number of codons

**5. Apply filters**:

- **Minimum length**: Usually >300 bp (100 codons)

- Too short → likely random

- **Codon bias**: Check if matches organism

- **Blast search**: Does it match known proteins?

**Example - Finding ORFs**:
```

```

```

```
Sequence: 5'-ATGAAATTTGCATAA-3'

Frame +1: ATG AAA TTT GCA TAA
          ↑                ↑
        Start            Stop

ORF = ATG AAA TTT GCA TAA (15 bp, 5 codons)
Protein = M K F A * (4 amino acids)

Too short? If minimum is 100 codons, this is rejected!
```

```

```
```

**Longest ORF heuristic**:

- In a random sequence, expect short ORFs

- Real genes = long ORFs

- **Find longest ORF in each frame**

- Usually the real gene!

**Statistics**:

- Random sequence: Average ORF = 64 codons (192 bp)

- Real genes: Average = 300-500 codons (900-1500 bp)

**Prokaryotic vs. Eukaryotic ORF Finding**:

**Prokaryotes** (easier):

- No introns

- ORF = gene

- High gene density

- Start-to-stop is complete

**Eukaryotes** (harder):

- Introns interrupt ORFs!

- Need to predict exons

- Splice sites required

- Much more complex

**Tools for ORF Finding**:

- **ORF Finder** (NCBI): Web-based, simple

- **GeneMark**: Ab initio with species-specific models

- **Glimmer**: Especially for bacteria

- **Augustus**: For eukaryotes with introns

**Computational Methods**:

- **Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)**: Statistical models of gene structure

- **Neural networks**: Machine learning approaches

- **Support vector machines**: Classification algorithms

**Famous ab initio tools**:

- GeneMark

- Augustus

- GENSCAN

- GlimmerHMM

**Pros**:
✅ Works for novel genomes (no reference needed)
✅ Fast computation
✅ Can find unique genes
✅ Good for prokaryotic genomes (simpler gene structure)

**Cons**:
❌ Lower accuracy than homology-based methods
❌ Misses short exons
❌ Struggles with alternative splicing
❌ Can't detect overlapping genes well
❌ High false positive rate

**Best for**: First-pass annotation of new genomes, prokaryotic genomes

### 2. Homology-Based Prediction (Comparison-Based)

**"Homology" means similarity** - compares to known genes!

**How it works**:

- Compares new genome to databases of known genes

- Uses evolutionary conservation

- If sequence is similar to known gene, probably also a gene!

**The principle**:
```

```

```

```
Known gene in mouse: ATGCCCAAAGGG
Your new sequence:   ATGCCCAAGGGG
                     ********** *  (90% identical)
→ Probably same gene in your organism!
```

```

```
```

**Methods**:

**1. Protein-to-Genome Alignment**:

- Use known proteins from databases

- Align them to genome

- Tools: BLASTX, GeneWise, Exonerate

**2. Genome-to-Genome Alignment**:

- Compare entire genomes

- Human vs. chimpanzee (99% similar!)

- Human vs. mouse (useful for finding conserved genes)

- Tools: BLAST, BLAT

**3. Expressed Sequence Evidence**:

- Use mRNA/cDNA sequences

- Direct evidence of gene expression!

- RNA-seq data is gold standard

- EST (Expressed Sequence Tag) databases

**Example**:

- Sequenced new organism (e.g., bonobo)

- Compare to human genome (very similar!)

- Transfer annotations from human to bonobo

- Refine with experimental data

**Pros**:
✅ High accuracy for conserved genes
✅ Can transfer functional annotations
✅ Benefits from decades of research on model organisms
✅ Works well for eukaryotic genomes

**Cons**:
❌ Requires reference genome/proteins
❌ Misses species-specific genes
❌ Biased toward well-studied organisms
❌ Can miss rapidly evolving genes

**Best for**: Well-conserved genes, organisms with close relatives

### 3. Integrated Approach (Best of Both Worlds!)

**Combining multiple evidence sources** - the modern standard!

**What it integrates**:

1. **Ab initio predictions** (statistical signals)

2. **Homology evidence** (similarity to known genes)

3. **RNA-seq data** (experimental evidence of transcription)

4. **Protein data** (mass spectrometry evidence)

5. **Comparative genomics** (conservation across species)

6. **Epigenomic data** (chromatin marks, histone modifications)

**How it works**:
```

```

```

```
Ab initio: Gene predicted at position X
Homology:  Similar to mouse gene at position X
RNA-seq:   Transcripts detected at position X
→ HIGH CONFIDENCE: Gene at position X!

Ab initio: Gene predicted at position Y
Homology:  No match
RNA-seq:   No expression
→ LOW CONFIDENCE: Probably false positive
```

```

```
```

**Modern integrated tools**:

- **MAKER**: Combines evidence, widely used

- **BRAKER**: Uses RNA-seq + ab initio

- **Ensembl pipeline**: Human genome annotation

- **NCBI pipeline**: RefSeq annotations

**Workflow**:

1. **Repeat masking** (remove repetitive DNA first!)

2. **Ab initio prediction** (first pass)

3. **Homology search** (compare to databases)

4. **RNA-seq alignment** (experimental evidence)

5. **Evidence integration** (combine all signals)

6. **Manual curation** (experts review tricky cases)

7. **Functional annotation** (predict gene functions)

**Pros**:
✅ **Highest accuracy**
✅ Catches genes missed by single methods
✅ Reduces false positives
✅ Provides confidence scores
✅ Standard for important genomes (human, mouse, etc.)

**Cons**:
❌ Requires multiple data types (expensive!)
❌ Computationally intensive
❌ Complex to implement
❌ Still not perfect - ~5-10% error rate

**Best for**: Important reference genomes, well-funded projects

## Gene Ontology (GO): A Universal Language for Gene Function

### What Is Gene Ontology?

**Gene Ontology (GO)** is a standardized classification system for describing gene and protein functions across all organisms [@geneontology2000; @geneontology2021].

Think of it like:

- 🌍 **Universal language** for biology (like how scientists worldwide use Latin names for species)

- 📚 **Dewey Decimal System** for genes (standardized classification)

- 🏷️ **Hashtags** for gene functions (standardized labels)

**Why we need GO**:

- Different organisms, same gene names mean different things

- Need consistent terminology across species

- Enables computational analysis

- Facilitates data sharing and integration

**Amazing fact**: GO terms are used to annotate genes from bacteria to humans!

### The Three Pillars of Gene Ontology

GO classifies genes into **three independent categories** (called ontologies):

![Gene Ontology Three Categories](images/ch17a/gene-ontology-overview.png)

**Figure 17.1**: The three main categories of Gene Ontology (GO): Molecular Function (what the molecule does), Biological Process (what larger process it's part of), and Cellular Component (where it's located).

*Image credit: Gene Ontology Consortium, CC BY 4.0*

### 1. Molecular Function (MF)

**Definition**: The **biochemical activity** of the gene product at the molecular level

Think of it as: **"What does this molecule DO?"**

**Examples**:

| GO Term ID | Term Name | What it Means | Example Genes |
|------------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| GO:0003677 | DNA binding | Sticks to DNA | Transcription factors |
| GO:0004672 | Protein kinase activity | Adds phosphate groups to proteins | PKA, PKC |
| GO:0005524 | ATP binding | Grabs ATP molecules | Many enzymes |
| GO:0016491 | Oxidoreductase activity | Moves electrons between molecules | Cytochrome P450 |
| GO:0003723 | RNA binding | Sticks to RNA | RNA-binding proteins |

**Key points:**

- Describes the biochemical action

- Independent of where or when it happens

- Based on the inherent capability of the molecule

**Important**: A gene can have **multiple molecular functions**!

### 2. Biological Process (BP)

**Definition**: The **broader biological objective** or pathway that the gene product contributes to

Think of it as: **"What is this molecule PART OF?"**

**Examples**:

| GO Term ID | Term Name | What it Means | Example Genes |
|------------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| GO:0006281 | DNA repair | Fixing damaged DNA | BRCA1, BRCA2 |
| GO:0007049 | Cell cycle | Cell division process | Cyclins, CDKs |
| GO:0006915 | Apoptosis | Programmed cell death | Caspases, p53 |
| GO:0006955 | Immune response | Fighting infections | Antibodies, cytokines |
| GO:0007165 | Signal transduction | Cellular signaling | Receptors, kinases |

**Key points:**

- Describes the larger biological context

- Multiple molecular functions contribute to one process

- Can be hierarchical (specific → general)

**Example hierarchy**:
```

```

```

```
DNA metabolic process (broad)
  └─ DNA repair (more specific)
      └─ Double-strand break repair (very specific)
          └─ Homologous recombination (most specific)
```

```

```
```

### 3. Cellular Component (CC)

**Definition**: The **location in the cell** where the gene product is active

Think of it as: **"WHERE in the cell is this molecule?"**

**Examples**:

| GO Term ID | Term Name | What it Means | Example Genes |
|------------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| GO:0005634 | Nucleus | Inside nuclear membrane | Histones, transcription factors |
| GO:0005739 | Mitochondrion | Mitochondrial compartment | Respiratory chain proteins |
| GO:0005886 | Plasma membrane | Cell surface membrane | Receptors, ion channels |
| GO:0005737 | Cytoplasm | Cellular cytoplasm | Many metabolic enzymes |
| GO:0005576 | Extracellular region | Outside the cell | Secreted proteins, antibodies |

**Key points:**

- Describes subcellular localization

- Can include complexes (e.g., "ribosome")

- Important for understanding protein function

**Subcompartments** exist too:
```

```

```

```
Mitochondrion (general)
  ├─ Mitochondrial matrix
  ├─ Mitochondrial inner membrane
  └─ Mitochondrial intermembrane space
```

```

```
```

### GO Term Structure and Identifiers

**Every GO term has**:

- **Unique ID**: GO:XXXXXXX (7 digits)

- **Term name**: Human-readable name

- **Definition**: Precise description

- **Relationships**: Connections to other terms

**Example - GO:0003677 (DNA binding)**:
```

```

```

```
ID: GO:0003677
Name: DNA binding
Ontology: Molecular Function
Definition: Any molecular function by which a gene product
            interacts selectively and non-covalently with DNA
Synonyms: microtubule/chromatin interaction
Relationships:

  - is_a: nucleic acid binding (GO:0003676)

  - part_of: Various processes

```

```
```

```

**Hierarchical structure** (parent-child relationships):

- **More general terms** at top (parents)

- **More specific terms** below (children)

- Allows for different levels of detail

### Practical Example: Actin Gene

Let's annotate **Actin** (a cytoskeletal protein):

**Gene**: ACTB (β-actin gene)

**GO Annotations**:

**Molecular Function**:

- GO:0003779 - Actin binding

- GO:0005200 - Structural constituent of cytoskeleton

**Biological Process**:

- GO:0030036 - Actin cytoskeleton organization

- GO:0016477 - Cell migration

- GO:0051301 - Cell division

**Cellular Component**:

- GO:0005737 - Cytoplasm

- GO:0005856 - Cytoskeleton

- GO:0015629 - Actin cytoskeleton

**Why multiple terms?** Actin does many things in different contexts!

### Practical Example: BRCA1 Gene

**Gene**: BRCA1 (Breast Cancer 1, tumor suppressor)

**GO Annotations**:

**Molecular Function**:

- GO:0003677 - DNA binding

- GO:0004842 - Ubiquitin-protein transferase activity

- GO:0008270 - Zinc ion binding

**Biological Process**:

- GO:0006281 - DNA repair

- GO:0000724 - Double-strand break repair via homologous recombination

- GO:0007049 - Cell cycle

- GO:0008283 - Cell proliferation

**Cellular Component**:

- GO:0005634 - Nucleus

- GO:0000785 - Chromatin

**Clinical relevance**: Mutations in BRCA1 disrupt DNA repair (GO:0006281), leading to cancer!

### How GO Annotations Are Created

**Two main approaches**:

**1. Manual Curation** (gold standard):

- Expert scientists read research papers

- Extract evidence for gene function

- Assign GO terms with evidence codes

- Time-consuming but accurate

**2. Computational Prediction**:

- Based on sequence similarity (homology)

- Transfer annotations from well-studied organisms

- Machine learning approaches

- Faster but less certain

**Quality codes:**

- **EXP**: Inferred from Experiment (most reliable)

- **IDA**: Inferred from Direct Assay

- **IMP**: Inferred from Mutant Phenotype

- **ISS**: Inferred from Sequence Similarity (computational)

- **IEA**: Inferred from Electronic Annotation (least reliable)

**Always check evidence codes!** Experimentally verified annotations are more trustworthy.

### Conservation Across Species

**GO enables cross-species comparisons!**

**Example - Actin**:

- Found in yeast, plants, mice, humans

- Same GO terms across species!

- GO:0003779 (Actin binding) applies to all

- Reveals evolutionary conservation

**Comparative genomics workflow**:

1. Identify homologous genes across species

2. Compare GO annotations

3. Conserved GO terms → essential functions

4. Species-specific GO terms → unique adaptations

### Using GO in Research

**Common applications**:

**1. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis**:

- Have list of 500 upregulated genes

- Which biological processes are enriched?

- Statistical test: Are certain GO terms over-represented?

- Reveals coordinated biological responses

**Example**:
```

```

```

```
Input: 500 genes upregulated in cancer
Output:

  - DNA repair (GO:0006281) - 50 genes (p < 0.001)

  - Cell cycle (GO:0007049) - 75 genes (p < 0.001)

  → Cancer affects DNA repair and cell division!
```

```

```
```

- Sequence unknown organism

- Find homologous genes with BLAST

- Transfer GO annotations from known organisms

- Predict functions computationally

**3. Disease Gene Discovery**:

| **UniProt** | Proteins | Manual (Swiss-Prot) | All organisms |

**Version control is critical**:

- Annotations change over time

- Always cite which version used!

- Example: "GENCODE v44 (2023)"

**Accessing annotations**:

**Programmatic access**:
```bash

```bash

```bash

```bash
# Download GENCODE human annotations
wget ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_human/release_44/gencode.v44.annotation.gtf.gz

# Download via Ensembl
wget ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-110/gtf/homo_sapiens/
```

```

```
```

**Web browsers**:

- UCSC Genome Browser: Shows RefSeq, GENCODE, Ensembl tracks

- Ensembl browser: Shows Ensembl annotations

- Can compare different annotation sources side-by-side!

**Annotation file formats**:

**GTF (Gene Transfer Format)**:
```

```

```

```
chr1  HAVANA  gene  11869  14409  .  +  .  gene_id "ENSG00000223972"
chr1  HAVANA  transcript  11869  14409  .  +  .  transcript_id "ENST00000456328"
chr1  HAVANA  exon  11869  12227  .  +  .  exon_id "ENSE00002234944"
```

```

```
```

**GFF3 (General Feature Format)**:

- Similar to GTF

- More flexible

- Supports hierarchical features

**Why multiple databases?**

**Different strengths**:

- **GENCODE**: Best for human/mouse RNA-seq analysis

- **RefSeq**: Best for clinical variant interpretation

- **Ensembl**: Best for comparative genomics

- **UniProt**: Best for protein function

**Discrepancies exist!**

- Same gene, different annotations

- Number of isoforms varies

- Exon boundaries differ slightly

- Choose database appropriate for your application

### Limitations of GO

**Important caveats**:

**1. Incompleteness**:

- Not all genes are annotated

- New functions continually discovered

- Bias toward well-studied organisms

**2. Annotation Quality Varies**:

- Some genes: extensive experimental evidence

- Others: only computational predictions

- Always check evidence codes!

**3. Context-Dependent Functions**:

- Gene may have different functions in different tissues

- GO doesn't always capture this nuance

- Temporal aspects not well represented

**4. Updating Annotations**:

- GO is constantly evolving

- Terms added, modified, made obsolete

- Need to use current version

- Citation matters!

### Best Practices for Using GO

**Do's**:
✅ Check evidence codes (prefer experimental)
✅ Use multiple GO terms (genes multitask!)
✅ Consider term hierarchies (specific → general)
✅ Keep GO database up to date
✅ Report GO version in publications
✅ Use enrichment analysis statistics properly

**Don'ts**:
❌ Don't rely solely on IEA (electronic) annotations
❌ Don't ignore term hierarchies
❌ Don't forget that annotations evolve
❌ Don't use GO terms in isolation
❌ Don't ignore p-values in enrichment analysis

### Future of Gene Ontology

**Ongoing developments**:

- **Causal Activity Models (CAMs)**: Representing molecular pathways

- **GO-CAM**: Integrating GO with pathway information

- **Better context representation**: Tissue-specific, temporal annotations

- **Machine learning**: Automated, high-quality predictions

- **Integration**: Linking GO with other ontologies (disease, anatomy, etc.)

**Vision**: Complete functional map of all genes in all organisms!

#### Challenges in Gene Prediction

**Why is gene prediction hard?**

**1. Alternative Splicing**:

- One gene → multiple transcripts

- Which exons are used when?

- ~95% of human genes alternatively spliced!

- Creates enormous complexity

**2. Overlapping Genes**:

- Genes on opposite DNA strands

- Genes within introns of other genes

- Hard for algorithms to detect

**3. Small Genes**:

- Short ORFs often missed

- Could be real genes or random

- MicroRNA genes are tiny!

**4. Pseudogenes**:

- Look like genes but are non-functional

- "Dead" copies from evolution

- ~20,000 pseudogenes in human genome

- Hard to distinguish from real genes

**5. Repetitive Sequences**:

- ~45% of human genome is repetitive!

- LINEs, SINEs, transposons everywhere

- Must be masked before annotation

- Can interfere with gene prediction

### 4. Variant Calling

**What it is**: Finding differences between genomes

**Why it matters**:

- Disease-causing mutations

- Drug response variants

- Evolutionary changes

- Personalized medicine

**Process**:

1. Sequence individual's genome

2. Compare to reference genome

3. Identify differences (SNPs, indels, etc.)

4. Annotate variants (what genes affected?)

5. Predict impact (harmful, benign, unknown?)

### 5. Gene Expression Analysis

**What it is**: Measuring which genes are active

**RNA-seq analysis**:

1. Sequence all RNA in sample

2. Count reads for each gene

3. Normalize data

4. Compare conditions (healthy vs. diseased)

5. Find differentially expressed genes

**Challenges**:

- Statistical analysis needed

- Multiple testing correction

- Biological vs. technical variation

### 6. Phylogenetic Analysis

**What it is**: Building evolutionary trees

**Process**:

1. Collect sequences from multiple species

2. Align sequences

3. Calculate evolutionary distances

4. Build tree showing relationships

**Uses**:

- Understanding evolution

- Tracking disease outbreaks (COVID-19!)

- Conservation biology

- Drug development

## Genome Browsers: Visualizing the Genome

### Genome Build Versions (Human)

Understanding **genome builds** is critical!

**Major human genome builds**:

**HG18** (NCBI Build 36, 2006):

- First "complete" draft

- Many gaps and errors

- Now obsolete - don't use!

**HG19** (GRCh37, 2009):

- Major improvement

- Used for ~10 years

- Still used in many studies

- Many databases still in HG19

**HG38** (GRCh38, 2013-present):

- Current standard

- Better assembly

- Better representation of genetic diversity

- Includes alternate loci (variants)

**What changes between builds?**

- **Sequence corrections**: Errors fixed

- **Gap filling**: Unknown regions sequenced

- **Coordinate changes**: Same gene, different position!

- **New genes added**: ~200-500 genes updated per build

- **Removed sequences**: Some were artifacts

**Critical warning**:
```

```

```

```
Gene X in HG19: chr17:43,044,295-43,125,483
Gene X in HG38: chr17:43,009,127-43,090,315
                         ↑
              Different coordinates!
```

```

```
```

**Always specify genome build in publications!**

**Liftover tools**:

- Convert coordinates between builds

- UCSC LiftOver tool

- Not always perfect - some regions can't convert!

### Why Genome Builds Keep Updating

## Sequence Alignment Algorithms

### Finding Similarities

**Why align sequences?**

- Find related genes

- Predict function

- Understand evolution

- Identify mutations

### BLAST: The Google of Bioinformatics

**BLAST** = Basic Local Alignment Search Tool [@altschul1990basic; @altschul1997gapped]

**What it does**:

- Takes your sequence

- Searches entire database

- Finds similar sequences

- Returns matches ranked by similarity

![BLAST Algorithm Overview](images/ch17a/blast-query-words.svg)

**Figure 17.2**: BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) algorithm showing the seed-and-extend strategy for finding similar sequences in databases.

**How fast?**

- Searches millions of sequences in seconds!

- Incredibly useful!

- Used millions of times per day worldwide!

### Types of BLAST

**Different BLAST programs for different tasks**:

| BLAST Type | Query | Database | Use Case |
|------------|-------|----------|----------|
| **BLASTN** | DNA/RNA | DNA/RNA | Find similar DNA sequences |
| **BLASTP** | Protein | Protein | Find similar proteins |
| **BLASTX** | DNA | Protein | Translate DNA, search proteins |
| **TBLASTN** | Protein | DNA | Search translated DNA with protein |
| **TBLASTX** | DNA | DNA | Both translated to protein first |

**When to use each**:

**BLASTN**:

- Identify species from DNA barcode

- Find orthologs in closely related species

- Map primers to genome

- Find contamination in sequencing

**BLASTP**:

- Predict protein function

- Find protein families

- Identify domains

- Evolutionary studies

**BLASTX**:

- Translate DNA in all 6 reading frames

- Search for protein homologs

- When you have DNA but want to find protein function

- Useful for ESTs, RNA-seq data

**Example use**:

- Found unknown gene in organism

- BLAST against database

- Find it matches insulin in mice

- Probably insulin in your organism too!

### Understanding BLAST Results

**Key metrics in BLAST output**:

**1. E-value (Expectation value)**:

- **Most important metric!**

- Probability of finding match by chance

- Lower = better!

**Interpretation**:

- **E < 1e-50**: Extremely significant match (almost certainly homologous)

- **E < 1e-10**: Very significant (likely homologous)

- **E < 0.01**: Significant (probably homologous)

- **E > 0.01**: Not significant (might be random)

**Example**:
```

```

```

```
E-value = 1e-100: Expect 1 match by chance in 10^100 searches (excellent!)
E-value = 0.05: Expect 1 match by chance in 20 searches (weak)
```

```

```
```

**2. Bit Score**:

- Normalized alignment score

- Higher = better

- Independent of database size (unlike E-value)

- Use for comparing across databases

**3. Percent Identity**:

- Percentage of identical residues

- **Critical for functional inference!**

**Identity thresholds for function prediction**:

- **>70%**: Very likely same function

- **40-70%**: Possibly related function (use caution!)

- **<40%**: Uncertain relationship (different function likely)

**Example**:
```

```

```

```
Query: Unknown protein from bacteria
Top BLAST hit:

  - Description: DNA helicase

  - E-value: 1e-85

  - Identity: 78%

  - Bit score: 320

Interpretation: Highly significant match (E-value), high identity (78%)
→ Query protein is likely a DNA helicase with similar function!
```

```

```
```

**4. Query Coverage**:

- Percentage of query sequence aligned

- Important for full-length matches

- Low coverage might indicate partial match or domain

**Best match characteristics**:

- Low E-value (< 1e-10)

- High identity (>70% for function)

- High coverage (>80%)

- High bit score

### Sequence Similarity and Functional Inference

**The similarity-function relationship**:

**Protein sequences**:

| % Identity | Functional Relationship | Confidence |
|------------|------------------------|------------|
| **>90%** | Same function, likely orthologs | **Very high** |
| **70-90%** | Same function, possible paralogs | **High** |
| **40-70%** | Related function, same family | **Moderate** |
| **25-40%** | Distant homologs, possibly different function | **Low** |
| **<25%** | Twilight zone - uncertain | **Very low** |

**DNA sequences** (more stringent):

| % Identity | Interpretation |
|------------|----------------|
| **>95%** | Same species, recent divergence |
| **85-95%** | Closely related species |
| **70-85%** | Related species, conserved genes |
| **<70%** | Distant relationship or chance |

**Important caveats**:

**1. Domain matches**:

- Proteins may share domains but have different functions

- Check if match is full-length or just domain!

**Example**:
```

```

```

```
Query: 500 aa protein
BLAST match: Kinase domain (100 aa) at 80% identity
→ Query has kinase domain but overall function unclear
```

```

```
```

**2. Multidomain proteins**:

- Proteins with multiple domains

- Each domain may match different proteins

- Function depends on domain combination

**3. Paralog vs. Ortholog**:

- **Orthologs**: Same gene in different species (usually same function)

- **Paralogs**: Related genes from duplication (often different function)

- High similarity doesn't guarantee same function if paralogs!

### Gene Families and Homology

**Homology** = Similarity due to common evolutionary origin

**Types**:

**1. Orthologs**:

- Same gene in different species

- Arose from speciation

- **Usually same function**

- Best for functional transfer!

**Example**:
```

```

```

```
Human β-globin ←→ Mouse β-globin (orthologs)
Both carry oxygen in red blood cells
```

```

```
```

**2. Paralogs**:

- Related genes within same genome

- Arose from gene duplication

- **Often diverged functions**

- Be careful transferring function!

**Example**:
```

```

```

```
Human α-globin ←→ Human β-globin (paralogs)
Both in hemoglobin but slightly different roles
```

```

```
```

**3. Gene Families**:

- Groups of related genes

- Share common ancestor

- Varying degrees of functional similarity

**Examples of gene families**:

- **Globin family**: α-globin, β-globin, myoglobin

- **Immunoglobulin family**: Antibodies, T-cell receptors

- **HOX genes**: Developmental regulators

- **Kinase family**: Thousands of kinases with related activity

**Phylogenetic analysis** helps distinguish orthologs from paralogs:

1. BLAST to find homologs

2. Build phylogenetic tree

3. Identify ortholog groups

4. Transfer function to orthologs (not paralogs!)

### Homology-Based Functional Annotation

**Workflow for annotating unknown gene**:

**Step 1: BLAST Search**
```

```

```

```
Query: Unknown gene from new organism
Database: NCBI nr (non-redundant protein)
Result: Top 100 hits
```

```

```
```

**Step 2: Examine Top Hits**
```

```

```

```
Hit 1: DNA polymerase III (E=1e-120, ID=75%)
Hit 2: DNA polymerase III (E=1e-118, ID=74%)
Hit 3: DNA polymerase III (E=1e-115, ID=73%)
...
→ Consistent annotation!
```

```

```
```

**Step 3: Check Evidence Quality**

- Are top hits experimentally validated?

- Or just computational predictions?

- Look for "RefSeq", "SwissProt" (curated)

- Avoid "TrEMBL", "Predicted" (less reliable)

**Step 4: Examine Domains**

- Use InterPro, Pfam to find domains

- DNA polymerase has polymerase domain

- Confirms function!

**Step 5: Check GO Terms**

- DNA polymerase III:

  - MF: DNA-directed DNA polymerase activity

  - BP: DNA replication

  - CC: Replisome

**Step 6: Assign Function with Confidence Level**
```

```

```

```
Gene annotation: DNA polymerase III subunit alpha
Evidence: BLAST (E=1e-120, ID=75%), Pfam domain, GO terms
Confidence: HIGH
```

```

```
```

### Common BLAST Pitfalls

**Problem 1: Low complexity regions**

**Issue**: Repetitive sequences (e.g., poly-A, poly-Q) give false matches

**Solution**: Use low-complexity filter (default in BLAST)
```

```

```

```
BLAST parameter: -seg yes (for proteins)
                  -dust yes (for DNA)
```

```

```
```

**Problem 2: Short queries**

**Issue**: Short sequences give many spurious hits

**Solution**:

- Need >30 aa for proteins, >50 bp for DNA

- Lower E-value threshold

- Use higher word size

**Problem 3: Database choice**

**Issue**: Wrong database gives misleading results

**Databases**:

- **nr**: All sequences (comprehensive but noisy)

- **RefSeq**: Curated, high quality (recommended!)

- **SwissProt**: Manually curated proteins (gold standard, but incomplete)

- **PDB**: Only sequences with 3D structures

- **Organism-specific**: Limit to taxonomic group

**Problem 4: Outdated databases**

**Issue**: Databases update frequently

**Solution**: Always use current database version!

**Problem 5: Misinterpreting paralogs as orthologs**

**Issue**: Transfer wrong function from paralog

**Solution**: Build phylogenetic tree to confirm orthology

### Advanced BLAST: PSI-BLAST

**PSI-BLAST** = Position-Specific Iterated BLAST

**What it does**:

- Iterative search

- Builds profile from first results

- Uses profile to find more distant homologs

- **Detects remote homologs** that regular BLAST misses!

**Workflow**:

1. Run initial BLAST

2. Build position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) from hits

3. Search again with PSSM

4. Iterate 3-5 rounds

5. Finds distant family members!

**Use cases**:

- Find distant evolutionary relationships

- Expand protein families

- Detect remote homologs (<30% identity)

**Caution**: Can diverge and pick up false positives in later iterations!

### BLAST for Primer Design

**Use BLAST to check primer specificity**:

**Goal**: Ensure primers bind only to target gene

**Workflow**:

1. Design primers for gene of interest

2. BLAST each primer against genome

3. Check for off-target matches

4. Redesign if necessary

**Settings for primer BLAST**:

- Short query (18-25 bp primers)

- Allow some mismatches

- Check both forward and reverse primers

- Use organism-specific database

**Tool**: NCBI Primer-BLAST (specialized for this!)

### Gene Family Example: Actin

**Using BLAST to study gene families**:

**Query**: Human β-actin

**BLAST results** (simplified):
```

```

```
```

1. Mouse β-actin      (E=0, ID=99%)  ← Ortholog

2. Rat β-actin        (E=0, ID=98%)  ← Ortholog

3. Human α-actin      (E=1e-180, ID=93%)  ← Paralog

4. Yeast actin        (E=1e-150, ID=88%)  ← Ancient ortholog

5. Plant actin        (E=1e-140, ID=85%)  ← Ancient ortholog

```

```
```

```

**Interpretation**:

- β-actin highly conserved across mammals (orthologs)

- α-actin and β-actin are paralogs (gene duplication)

- Actin family ancient (found in yeast, plants!)

- All have similar function (cytoskeleton)

### BLAST Databases

**Major databases**:

**1. NCBI nr (non-redundant)**:

- All GenBank + RefSeq + PDB + SwissProt

- Most comprehensive

- Updated daily

- Some redundancy despite name!

**2. RefSeq**:

- Curated reference sequences

- High quality annotations

- Non-redundant

- **Recommended for most uses**

**3. SwissProt** (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot):

- Manually curated

- Highest quality

- Experimental evidence

- But incomplete coverage

**4. TrEMBL** (UniProtKB/TrEMBL):

- Computationally annotated

- Comprehensive but lower quality

- Supplement to SwissProt

**5. PDB**:

- Only proteins with 3D structures

- Small but high-quality

- Use for structural comparisons

**6. Organism-specific**:

- Human, mouse, E. coli, etc.

- Faster searches

- More relevant results

### Interpreting BLAST for Pathogen Identification

**Use case**: Unknown bacteria, want to identify species

**Workflow**:

1. Sequence 16S rRNA gene (universal barcode)

2. BLAST against 16S rRNA database

3. Top hit identifies species

**Example**:
```

```

```

```
Query: 16S rRNA from unknown bacteria
Top BLAST hit:

  - Escherichia coli str. K-12 (E=0, ID=99.8%)

Interpretation: Sample is E. coli K-12 strain
```

```

```
```

**Critical thresholds** (16S rRNA):

- **>99%**: Same species

- **97-99%**: Likely same species

- **95-97%**: Same genus

- **<95%**: Different genus

### BLAST Best Practices

**Do's**:
✅ Use appropriate BLAST type (BLASTN vs. BLASTP)
✅ Check E-value AND percent identity
✅ Examine multiple top hits (consensus annotation)
✅ Use curated databases when possible (RefSeq, SwissProt)
✅ Consider query coverage
✅ Distinguish orthologs from paralogs
✅ Check domain architecture
✅ Keep databases updated

**Don'ts**:
❌ Don't rely on single BLAST hit
❌ Don't ignore E-value
❌ Don't assume high similarity = same function (check for paralogs!)
❌ Don't use outdated databases
❌ Don't transfer function from distant homologs (<40% identity)
❌ Don't forget to filter low-complexity regions

### Pairwise Alignment

**Comparing two sequences**:

**Global alignment** (Needleman-Wunsch):

- Align entire sequences end-to-end

- Best for similar-length, similar sequences

**Local alignment** (Smith-Waterman):

- Find best matching regions

- Don't need to align everything

- BLAST uses this approach!

### Multiple Sequence Alignment

**Aligning many sequences at once**:

- Finds conserved regions across species

- Reveals important functional sites

- Used for phylogenetics

**Tools**: MUSCLE, MAFFT, Clustal Omega

## Sequence Conservation and Evolutionary Analysis

### What Is Sequence Conservation?

**Conservation** = How similar a DNA/protein sequence is across different species or within a genome [@siepel2005evolutionarily; @pollard2010detection].

Think of it like:

- 📖 **Ancient texts** preserved through copying (important texts conserved more carefully)

- 🏛️ **Historical buildings** maintained over centuries (functional ones preserved)

- 💎 **Family heirlooms** passed down unchanged (valuable things kept safe)

**The principle**: **If a sequence is conserved, it's probably important!**

**Why?**

- Natural selection eliminates harmful mutations

- Functional sequences resist change

- Non-functional sequences accumulate random mutations

- Evolution is the ultimate experiment!

### Why Conservation Matters

**Conservation reveals**:

**1. Functional Importance**:

- Highly conserved → functionally critical

- Variable regions → less critical

- Like finding which parts of a machine are essential

**2. Regulatory Elements**:

- Conserved non-coding sequences often regulatory

- Enhancers, promoters, silencers

- Hard to find by sequence alone

- Conservation highlights them!

**3. Disease-Causing Mutations**:

- Mutations in conserved regions more likely pathogenic

- Used in clinical variant interpretation

- Conservation score predicts impact

**4. Drug Targets**:

- Target conserved regions in pathogens

- Avoid conserved regions in humans

- Reduces side effects

### Measuring Conservation

**Conservation score** = Quantitative measure of sequence similarity

**Range**: Typically 0 to 1 (or 0 to 100%)

- **1.0** (100%) = Perfectly conserved (identical across species)

- **0.5** (50%) = Moderately conserved

- **0.0** (0%) = Not conserved (random variation)

**Popular methods**:

**1. PhyloP**:

- Tests for conservation vs. neutral evolution

- Positive scores = conserved

- Negative scores = accelerated evolution

- Based on phylogenetic trees

**2. PhastCons**:

- Identifies conserved elements

- Hidden Markov Model approach

- Returns probability of conservation

- Smooths across neighboring bases

**3. GERP (Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling)**:

- Detects constrained elements

- Compares observed vs. expected substitutions

- Positive scores = conserved

- Widely used in clinical genomics

### Conservation Across Genome Regions

Different parts of genes show different conservation levels:

| Region | Conservation | Why? |
|--------|--------------|------|
| **Exons** (coding) | **Very high** | Changes alter protein sequence |
| **Start/Stop codons** | **Extremely high** | Essential for translation |
| **Promoters** | **High** | Required for transcription |
| **Splice sites** | **Very high** | GT...AG boundaries critical |
| **Enhancers** | **Moderate to high** | Functional but flexible |
| **Introns** | **Low to moderate** | Some regulatory elements |
| **5' and 3' UTRs** | **Moderate** | Regulatory sequences present |
| **Intergenic** | **Low** | Mostly non-functional |

**Example - BRCA1 gene**:
```

```

```

```
Conservation track (UCSC Genome Browser):
Exon 11: ████████████ (0.95 - highly conserved)
Intron 10: ▒▒▒░░░▒▒░░░ (0.35 - less conserved)
Promoter: ████▒▒████ (0.80 - conserved)
```

```

```
```

**Interpretation**: Exons and promoter are conserved (functional), introns less so

### Conservation and Codon Usage

**Synonymous vs. Non-synonymous mutations**:

**Synonymous (silent) mutations**:

- Change DNA codon but **NOT** amino acid

- Example: CTT → CTC (both code for Leucine)

- Often tolerated (lower selection pressure)

- Lower impact on conservation

**Non-synonymous mutations**:

- Change DNA codon AND amino acid

- Example: CTT (Leu) → CAT (His)

- Often deleterious if in conserved region

- Higher selection pressure against them

**Conservation scoring accounts for this**:

- Non-synonymous changes in conserved regions → high pathogenicity score

- Synonymous changes → lower pathogenicity score

- Transition mutations (purine ↔ purine, pyrimidine ↔ pyrimidine) more tolerated than transversions

### Example: Actin Conservation

**Actin** is one of the most conserved proteins!

**Comparison**:

- Yeast actin vs. Human actin

- **Sequence similarity: ~90%!**

- Separated by >1 billion years of evolution

- Conservation score near 1.0 across entire gene

**Why so conserved?**

- Essential for cell structure

- Interacts with many proteins

- Changes break cellular machinery

- Strong negative selection

**Practical implication**: Can study human actin in yeast! (Model organisms)

### Example: UTR Conservation

**5' and 3' UTRs** (Untranslated Regions):

**Generally less conserved than exons**:

- Exons: 0.85-0.95 conservation

- UTRs: 0.50-0.70 conservation

**But important exceptions**:

- microRNA binding sites in 3' UTR → highly conserved

- Regulatory elements in 5' UTR → conserved

- Shows functional importance!

**Practical use**:

1. Sequence gene across species

2. Align UTRs

3. Find conserved patches

4. → Likely regulatory elements!

### PhyloP and PhastCons Scores

**PhyloP** (Phylogenetic P-values):

**What it measures**:

- Conservation or acceleration at each position

- Based on multiple species alignment

- Statistical significance of conservation

**Score interpretation**:

- **PhyloP > +2.0**: Highly conserved (p < 0.05)

- **PhyloP = 0**: Neutral evolution

- **PhyloP < -2.0**: Accelerated evolution (positive selection?)

**PhastCons** (Phylogenetic Hidden Markov Model Conservation):

**What it measures**:

- Probability that each position is in a conserved element

- Considers neighboring positions (smoothing)

- Better for finding conserved regions (not just bases)

**Score interpretation**:

- **PhastCons > 0.8**: Likely in conserved element

- **PhastCons 0.3-0.8**: Moderate conservation

- **PhastCons < 0.3**: Not conserved

**Visualizing in genome browser**:
```

```

```

```
UCSC Genome Browser → Add Track → Conservation

- Vertebrate Conservation (100 species)

- Mammal Conservation (60 species)

- Primate Conservation (20 species)

View PhyloP and PhastCons tracks side-by-side!
```

```

```
```

### Using Conservation in Variant Interpretation

**Clinical genetics workflow**:

**Step 1**: Patient has variant in gene
**Step 2**: Check conservation at that position
**Step 3**: Interpret:

| Conservation Score | Interpretation | Likelihood of Pathogenicity |
|--------------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| **PhyloP > 5** | Extremely conserved | **Very high** - likely pathogenic |
| **PhyloP 2-5** | Highly conserved | **High** - likely damaging |
| **PhyloP 0-2** | Moderately conserved | **Moderate** - uncertain |
| **PhyloP < 0** | Not conserved | **Low** - likely benign |

**Example**:
```

```

```

```
Patient variant: BRCA1 c.5266dupC (frameshift)
Position: Exon 20
PhyloP score: 6.8 (extremely conserved)
Interpretation: Highly conserved region → variant likely pathogenic
Clinical action: High-risk cancer surveillance
```

```

```
```

**ACMG Guidelines** (Clinical variant interpretation):

- Conservation is **"Supporting" evidence** for pathogenicity

- Combined with other evidence (functional studies, population frequency, etc.)

- Not used alone!

### Conserved Non-Coding Elements

**Surprising discovery**: Some non-coding regions extremely conserved!

**Examples**:

**1. Ultraconserved Elements (UCEs)**:

- **100% identical** across human, mouse, rat

- Often >200 bp long

- Function often unknown!

- Likely critical regulatory elements

**2. Conserved Non-coding Sequences (CNS)**:

- High conservation in intergenic regions

- Enhancers for developmental genes

- Many near Hox genes, transcription factors

**3. MicroRNA binding sites**:

- Short conserved sequences in 3' UTRs

- ~7 nucleotides (seed region)

- Critical for gene regulation

**Discovery method**:

1. Align human genome to 100 vertebrate genomes

2. Find conserved regions outside genes

3. Test in experiments (reporter assays)

4. → Many are enhancers!

**Clinical importance**: Mutations in these regions can cause disease!

**Example**: Mutations in sonic hedgehog (SHH) enhancer cause limb malformations, even though SHH gene itself is normal!

### Evolutionary Rate and Selection

**Rate of evolution** varies by selective pressure:

**Strong purifying selection** (negative selection):

- Removes harmful mutations

- **Result**: High conservation

- **Example**: Active site of enzymes

**Neutral evolution**:

- No selection pressure

- **Result**: Low conservation

- **Example**: Synonymous sites, intergenic regions

**Positive selection**:

- Favors new mutations

- **Result**: Accelerated evolution (low conservation, but meaningful!)

- **Example**: Immune system genes (fighting ever-changing pathogens)

**dN/dS ratio** (Non-synonymous/Synonymous substitution rate):

- **dN/dS < 1**: Purifying selection (conserved)

- **dN/dS = 1**: Neutral evolution

- **dN/dS > 1**: Positive selection (adaptive)

### Conservation-Based Gene Finding

**Strategy**: Use conservation to find genes!

**Approach**:

1. Align genome to related species

2. Find conserved ORFs

3. → Likely protein-coding genes!

**Advantages**:

- Confirms ab initio predictions

- Finds genes missed by other methods

- Reduces false positives

**Example**:
```

```

```

```
Ab initio prediction: 100 potential genes
Conservation filtering: 82 conserved ORFs
→ High confidence: 82 genes
→ Low confidence: 18 genes (likely false positives)
```

```

```
```

### Mutation Types and Conservation Impact

**Impact varies by mutation type and conservation**:

| Mutation Type | Conserved Region | Non-Conserved Region |
|---------------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Synonymous** | Low impact | Very low impact |
| **Missense** (amino acid change) | **High impact** | Low-moderate impact |
| **Nonsense** (stop codon) | **Very high impact** | Moderate impact |
| **Frameshift** | **Extremely high impact** | Moderate-high impact |
| **Splice site** | **Extremely high impact** | Moderate impact (if in conserved intron) |

**Practical application**: Prioritize variants in conserved regions for follow-up studies

### Tools for Conservation Analysis

**Genome browsers**:

- **UCSC Genome Browser**: PhyloP, PhastCons tracks

- **Ensembl**: Conservation scores

- **IGV**: Load conservation tracks

**Variant effect predictors**:

- **CADD** (Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion): Integrates conservation

- **SIFT**: Uses sequence conservation to predict impact

- **PolyPhen-2**: Considers conservation in pathogenicity scoring

**Command-line tools**:

- **phyloP**: Calculate conservation scores

- **phastCons**: Identify conserved elements

- **GERP++**: Genomic conservation scoring

### Limitations of Conservation Analysis

**Important caveats**:

**1. Species-Specific Functions**:

- Not all functional elements are conserved

- Recent evolutionary innovations not conserved

- Human-specific regulatory elements missed

**2. Incomplete Sampling**:

- Conservation depends on which species compared

- More species → better power

- But bias toward well-sequenced organisms

**3. Neutral Conserved Regions**:

- Low mutation rate ≠ functional importance

- Some regions conserved by chance

- Need experimental validation

**4. Rapidly Evolving Functional Elements**:

- Some genes under positive selection

- Immune genes, olfactory receptors

- Low conservation doesn't mean non-functional!

### Best Practices

**Do's**:
✅ Use conservation as **one line of evidence**, not sole criterion
✅ Consider multiple species alignments
✅ Use appropriate conservation metric (PhyloP, PhastCons, GERP)
✅ Account for mutation type (synonymous vs. non-synonymous)
✅ Validate with experimental data when possible

**Don'ts**:
❌ Don't assume low conservation = non-functional
❌ Don't ignore species-specific elements
❌ Don't use conservation alone for clinical decisions
❌ Don't forget that conservation evolves (some elements lost/gained)

## Practical Application: Mutation and Disease Analysis

### Integrating Bioinformatics for Clinical Genomics

**Workflow**: Patient with suspected genetic disease

**Goal**: Identify disease-causing mutation and understand mechanism

### Step-by-Step Clinical Analysis

**Step 1: Variant Detection from Sequencing**
```

```

```

```
Patient DNA → Whole exome/genome sequencing → Variant calling
Result: List of ~20,000-100,000 variants (SNPs, indels) per patient
```

```

```
```

**Challenge**: Which variant causes disease?

**Step 2: Variant Filtering**

**Apply computational filters**:

1. **Frequency filter**: Remove common variants (MAF > 1%)

   - Disease-causing variants usually rare

   - Use gnomAD database

   - Reduces to ~1,000 variants

2. **Gene filter**: Focus on disease-relevant genes

   - Known disease genes

   - Genes in relevant pathway

   - Reduces to ~100-500 variants

3. **Functional impact filter**: Prioritize high-impact variants

   - Nonsense, frameshift → HIGH

   - Missense in conserved region → MODERATE

   - Synonymous → LOW

   - Reduces to ~10-50 candidates

**Step 3: Variant Annotation**

**For each candidate variant, determine**:

**A. Gene and Region Affected**

- Which gene?

- Exon, intron, UTR, promoter?

- Use genome browser (UCSC, Ensembl)

**B. Functional Prediction**

- BLAST homology: Is position conserved?

- PhyloP conservation score

- SIFT/PolyPhen prediction (pathogenic vs. benign)

**C. Existing Knowledge**

- Check ClinVar database

- Has this variant been reported?

- Known pathogenic/benign classification?

**D. Gene Ontology**

- What pathways affected?

- Compatible with patient phenotype?

**Step 4: Detailed Analysis of Top Candidate**

**Example case**:
```

```

```

```

Sequencing: Exome sequencing
Candidate variant: MYH7 c.2389C>T (p.Arg797Cys)
```

```

```
```

**Annotation workflow**:

**1. Gene identification**:

- Location: Chromosome 14

- Function: Cardiac muscle contraction

**2. ORF and protein impact**:

- ORF disruption: Missense mutation (Arg → Cys)

- Position: Codon 797 in exon 21

- Protein domain: Motor domain (critical!)

**3. Conservation analysis**:

- BLAST MYH7 across species:

  - Human-Mouse: 98% identity

  - Human-Zebrafish: 85% identity

- Position 797 (Arg):

  - PhyloP score: 7.2 (highly conserved!)

  - 100% conserved across all vertebrates

- → Mutation at highly conserved position

**4. Functional prediction**:

- SIFT score: 0.01 (deleterious, cutoff 0.05)

- PolyPhen-2: 0.98 (probably damaging, cutoff 0.85)

- CADD score: 28 (pathogenic, cutoff 20)

- → All predictors agree: pathogenic!

**5. Gene Ontology**:

- MF: Motor activity (GO:0003774)

- BP: Cardiac muscle contraction (GO:0060048)

- CC: Myosin complex (GO:0016459)

- → Gene function matches patient phenotype!

**6. ClinVar check**:

- Variant reported 15 times

- Classification: **Pathogenic**

- Associated disease: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

- → Known disease-causing variant!

**7. Literature review**:

- PubMed search: MYH7 + cardiomyopathy

- Multiple papers confirm pathogenicity

- Functional studies show disrupted muscle contraction

**Conclusion**: MYH7 p.Arg797Cys is disease-causing variant

**Clinical action**: Genetic counseling, family screening, treatment plan

### Mutation Analysis: Promoter Regions

**Scenario**: Mutation in promoter region

**Challenge**: Promoters not translated → no protein change, but affects expression

**Analysis approach**:

**1. Identify promoter elements**:

- Use genome browser (UCSC)

- Look for CpG islands, TATA box, transcription factor binding sites

- Check conservation across species

**2. Assess mutation location**:

- Is mutation in core promoter? (critical!)

- In enhancer region?

- In transcription factor binding site?

**3. Predict transcriptional impact**:

- Mutations in TATA box → reduced transcription

- Mutations in enhancer → tissue-specific effects

- Use tools: JASPAR (TF binding site prediction)

**4. Experimental validation**:

- Reporter assays (luciferase)

- Clone promoter with/without mutation

- Measure expression level

- Validate computational predictions!

**Example**:
```

```

```

```
Variant: β-globin promoter mutation (-28 A>G)
Effect: Reduced transcription by 70%
Disease: β-thalassemia (low hemoglobin)
Mechanism: Disrupts TATA box recognition
```

```

```
```

### Mutation Analysis: UTR Regions

**5' UTR mutations**:

- Affect translation efficiency

- Can create upstream ORFs (uORFs)

- Interfere with ribosome scanning

**3' UTR mutations**:

- Affect mRNA stability

- Disrupt microRNA binding sites

- Change polyadenylation

**Analysis**:

1. Check conservation (conserved UTR patches → regulatory!)

2. Predict microRNA binding sites (TargetScan, miRanda)

3. Assess polyadenylation signals

4. Reporter assays to measure mRNA stability

### Drug Target Discovery Workflow

**Goal**: Find new antibiotic targets against pathogenic bacteria

**Strategy**: Target essential bacterial genes not found in humans

**Workflow**:

**Step 1: Sequence pathogen genome**
```

```

```

```
Example: New drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain
→ Whole genome sequencing
→ Gene annotation (ab initio + homology)
```

```

```
```

**Step 2: Identify essential genes**

- Literature: Known essential genes in related bacteria

- Experiments: Transposon mutagenesis screens

- Result: ~300 essential genes

**Step 3: Filter for bacterial-specific genes**
```

```

```

```
For each essential gene:
  BLAST against human genome
  If high similarity (>50%) → EXCLUDE (would affect human!)
  If no/low similarity → KEEP as candidate

Result: ~150 bacterial-specific essential genes
```

```

```
```

**Step 4: GO term analysis**

- Group by function:

  - Cell wall synthesis (30 genes)

  - DNA replication (25 genes)

  - Protein synthesis (40 genes)

  - Metabolism (55 genes)

**Step 5: Prioritize druggable targets**

- Enzymes > structural proteins (easier to inhibit)

- Look for active sites, binding pockets

- Check if similar targets already drugged

- Result: ~20 high-priority targets

**Step 6: Conservation across bacterial strains**
```

```

```

```
BLAST each target across:

  - Multiple S. aureus strains

  - Related bacteria (broad-spectrum potential)

Highly conserved (>90%) → Broad-spectrum antibiotic!
Variable → Strain-specific target
```

```

```
```

**Step 7: Experimental validation**

- Synthesize/purify target protein

- Screen chemical libraries for inhibitors

- Test in bacterial growth assays

- Lead optimization

**Example outcome**:
```

```

```

```
Target: FabI (enoyl-ACP reductase)
Function: Fatty acid synthesis (essential)
GO terms: Lipid metabolic process
Conservation: 95% across Staph species
Human homolog: Different enzyme (safe!)
Drug: Triclosan (proof of concept)
Status: Validated antibiotic target!
```

```

```
```

### Annotation Best Practices Summary

From the lecture notes, **key principles for robust annotation**:

**1. Cross-validation**:

- Use multiple algorithms (ab initio + homology + RNA-seq)

- Compare results

- Trust consensus predictions

**2. Avoid automation errors**:

- Computational predictions not perfect

- Manual curation essential for important genes

- Expert review reduces errors

**3. Account for alternative splicing**:

- Multiple isoforms from one gene

- Different proteins, different functions

- Annotate all isoforms

**4. Document methods clearly**:

- Which tools used?

- Which databases?

- Which genome build (HG19 vs HG38)?

- Essential for reproducibility!

**5. Use multiple evidence types**:

- Sequence similarity (BLAST)

- Conservation (PhyloP/PhastCons)

- Expression data (RNA-seq)

- Protein evidence (mass spec)

## Primer Design and Quantitative PCR (qPCR)

### What Are Primers?

**Primers** = Short DNA sequences (18-25 nucleotides) that bind to template DNA and initiate DNA synthesis

Think of primers like:

- 🎯 **GPS coordinates** telling DNA polymerase where to start

- 🔑 **Keys** that unlock specific DNA regions for amplification

- 🏁 **Starting flags** marking where copying begins

**Why we need them**:

- DNA polymerase cannot start synthesis de novo (from scratch)

- Needs 3'-OH group from existing nucleotide

- Primers provide this starting point!

**Historical note**: This is why DNA polymerase differs from RNA polymerase (which CAN start de novo)

### Primer Design Principles

**Critical parameters** for successful primers:

**1. Length**:

- **Optimal**: 18-25 nucleotides

- **Too short** (<15 bp): Not specific enough (binds multiple sites)

- **Too long** (>30 bp): Expensive, slow annealing

**2. Melting Temperature (Tm)**:

- Temperature at which 50% of primers bind to template

- **Optimal**: 55-65°C

- **Forward and reverse primers should have similar Tm** (within 2-3°C)

- Calculate using formula or online tools

**Basic Tm calculation**:
```

```

```

```
Tm = 4(G+C) + 2(A+T)  (rough estimate)

Example primer: 5'-ATGCGTACGGATCCGTAA-3'
A=4, T=3, G=5, C=6
Tm = 4(5+6) + 2(4+3) = 44 + 14 = 58°C
```

```

```
```

**More accurate**: Use Nearest-Neighbor method or online calculators

**3. GC Content**:

- Percentage of G and C nucleotides

- **Optimal**: 40-60%

- **Too low** (<30%): Weak binding

- **Too high** (>70%): Too strong binding, non-specific

**4. Specificity**:

- Primer should bind ONLY to target sequence

- Check with BLAST (Primer-BLAST tool)

- Avoid repetitive sequences

- Avoid homopolymeric runs (AAAA, GGGG, etc.)

**5. Avoiding Secondary Structures**:

**Self-complementarity**:

- Primer shouldn't bind to itself

- Causes primer-dimers (waste primers!)

```
```

```

```
Bad: 5'-ATGCGCGCAT-3'
      ||||||||| (palindrome - binds to itself!)
```

```

```
```

**Hairpins**:

- Intramolecular folding

- Prevents primer from binding template

```
```

```

```
Bad primer with hairpin:
5'-ATGCGGCCGCAT-3'
    ↓    ↑
    ====== (stem-loop structure)
```

```

```
```

**6. 3' End Stability**:

- Last 5 nucleotides at 3' end critical

- Should have 1-2 G or C (but not all GCs!)

- **Avoid**: Multiple Gs/Cs at 3' end (binds non-specifically)

### Primer Design for Different Applications

### A. PCR Amplification

**Goal**: Amplify specific DNA region

**Design strategy**:

1. Identify target region (gene, exon, etc.)

2. Design forward primer at 5' end of region

3. Design reverse primer at 3' end (complement!)

4. Product size: 100-1000 bp ideal

**Example**:
```

```

```

```
Target: Amplify exon 5 of BRCA1 gene

5' ====[Exon 5]====3'
   ↑            ↑
   FP          RP

Forward primer (FP): Binds at start of exon
Reverse primer (RP): Binds at end (reverse complement!)

Product: Complete exon 5 sequence
```

```

```
```

**Using genome browser for primer design**:

1. Open UCSC Genome Browser

2. Navigate to target gene

3. Zoom to region of interest

4. View sequence (Tools → View DNA)

5. Extract sequences for primer design

6. **Avoid introns!** (primers should span exon-exon junctions or be in exons only)

### B. qPCR (Quantitative PCR / Real-Time PCR)

**Goal**: Measure gene expression levels (how much mRNA?)

**Different from regular PCR**:

- Measures product in **real-time** (not just endpoint)

- Quantitative (not just yes/no)

- Uses fluorescent dyes or probes

**Primer design for qPCR is MORE STRINGENT**:

**Key differences**:

**1. Product size**:

- **Optimal**: 80-150 bp (shorter than regular PCR!)

- Short amplicons = more efficient qPCR

**2. Avoid genomic DNA contamination**:

- Design primers across exon-exon junctions

- Or use DNase treatment

**Example**:
```

```

```

```
Gene structure:
[Exon 1]--intron--[Exon 2]--intron--[Exon 3]

Bad design (amplifies genomic DNA too):
  FP in Exon 1 → RP in Exon 1
  (genomic DNA and cDNA both amplified)

Good design (cDNA specific):
  FP in Exon 1 → RP in Exon 2
  (spans intron - only cDNA amplified!)

Genomic DNA gives no product (intron too large)
cDNA gives short product (introns removed)
```

```

```
```

**3. No template controls essential**:

- Include wells with no template

- Check for primer-dimers

**4. Reference genes**:

- Need housekeeping gene for normalization

- GAPDH, β-actin, 18S rRNA

- Should have stable expression

### qPCR Workflow

**Step 1: RNA Extraction**

- Extract total RNA from cells/tissue

- Measure concentration (NanoDrop, Qubit)

**Step 2: Reverse Transcription (RT)**

- Convert RNA → cDNA using reverse transcriptase

- Now have DNA template for qPCR

**Step 3: qPCR Reaction**

- Mix cDNA + primers + fluorescent dye (e.g., SYBR Green)

- Run thermal cycles

- Monitor fluorescence in real-time

**Step 4: Data Analysis**

- Ct value (Cycle threshold): Cycle at which fluorescence exceeds background

- Lower Ct = more template (higher expression!)

- **ΔΔCt method** for quantification

**Ct interpretation**:
```

```

```

```
Gene A in control cells: Ct = 20
Gene A in treated cells: Ct = 17

Difference = 3 cycles
Each cycle = 2x amplification
2^3 = 8-fold higher expression in treated cells!
```

```

```
```

```

**Step 4: Design primers**
```

```

```

```
Forward primer (spans junction):
5'-GAATGGAAGAATGCCAAG-3'
  (last 5 bp of exon 10 + first 13 bp of exon 11)
  Tm: 58°C, GC: 44%

Reverse primer (in exon 11):
5'-GCATAGTTCTTGGCATTC-3' (reverse complement)
  Tm: 58°C, GC: 50%

Product size: 120 bp (ideal for qPCR!)
```

```

```
```

**Step 5: Check specificity with Primer-BLAST**

- No off-target amplification ✓

- Only hits BRCA1 ✓

- Ready to order!

**Step 6: Experimental validation**

- Test primers with positive control (BRCA1 cDNA)

- Check melt curve (single peak = specific!)

- Confirm product size by gel electrophoresis

### Troubleshooting Primer Problems

**Problem 1: No amplification**

**Causes**:

- Primers don't bind (wrong sequence)

- Template degraded

- Annealing temperature too high

**Solutions**:

- Check primer sequences

- Fresh template

- Gradient PCR (test range of temperatures)

**Problem 2: Multiple bands**

**Causes**:

- Non-specific primer binding

- Primer-dimers

**Solutions**:

- Redesign primers (higher specificity)

- Increase annealing temperature

- Touchdown PCR protocol

**Problem 3: Primer-dimers in qPCR**

**Cause**:

- Primers bind to each other instead of template

**Solution**:

- Redesign to avoid complementarity

- Reduce primer concentration

- Check no-template control

**Problem 4: Variable Ct values (qPCR)**

**Causes**:

- Pipetting errors

- RNA quality issues

- Inhibitors in reaction

**Solutions**:

- Careful pipetting (use repeat pipettors)

- Check RNA integrity (RIN score)

- Dilute template (reduce inhibitors)

### Expression vs. Amplification Primer Design

**Key difference**: Where primers bind matters for purpose!

**For expression quantification (qPCR)**:

- Primers must be **mRNA-specific**

- Span exon-exon junctions

- Avoid amplifying genomic DNA

- In coding region of gene

**For gene verification/amplification**:

- Primers can be anywhere in gene

- Introns OK if amplifying genomic DNA

- Promoter region OK for regulatory studies

**Example**:
```

```

```

```
Quantify BRCA1 expression (qPCR):
  → Primers span exon 10-11 junction
  → Only amplifies cDNA (mRNA-derived)

Amplify BRCA1 promoter (regular PCR):
  → Primers in promoter region
  → Amplifies genomic DNA
  → Use for mutation screening
```

```

```
```
