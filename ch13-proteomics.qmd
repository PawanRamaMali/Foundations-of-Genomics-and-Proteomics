# Proteomics

## From Transcript to Protein

### What Is Proteomics?

**Proteomics** is the large-scale study of proteins—their structures, functions, and interactions.

**The "ome" suffix**:
- Gen**ome** = all DNA
- Transcript**ome** = all RNA
- Prote**ome** = all proteins

Think of the proteome as all the workers actually doing jobs in your cells right now!

### Why Study Proteins?

**Proteins are where the action is**:
- Genes are instructions
- RNA is the messenger
- **Proteins do the actual work**!

Understanding proteins helps us:
- Know how cells function
- Understand diseases
- Develop better medicines
- Design new therapies

## The Journey: DNA → RNA → Protein

### Quick Review

**1. Transcription**: DNA → RNA
- Makes mRNA copy of gene
- In the nucleus

**2. Translation**: RNA → Protein
- Ribosomes read mRNA
- tRNAs bring amino acids
- Amino acids link together
- Forms protein chain

**3. Protein Folding**: Linear chain → 3D structure
- Protein folds into specific 3D shape
- Shape determines function
- "Structure equals function"!

### The Proteome Is More Complex Than the Transcriptome

**Why?**
- One gene → multiple RNA variants (alternative splicing)
- One RNA → one protein chain
- BUT one protein chain → multiple modified forms!

**Post-translational modifications** (we'll discuss next) create even MORE diversity!

**Result**:
- ~20,000 genes
- ~100,000 RNA variants
- **Over 1 million different protein forms**!

## Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs)

### Proteins Get Modified After They're Made

After a protein is made, it can be modified in many ways!

**Post-translational modifications (PTMs)** = Chemical changes to proteins after translation

Think of it like:
- Making a basic clay pot (translation)
- Then decorating it (PTMs)
- The decorations change how it's used!

### Common Types of PTMs

### 1. Phosphorylation

**What happens**: Adding a phosphate group (PO₄) to amino acids

**Where**: Usually on serine, threonine, or tyrosine amino acids

**Effects**:
- Changes protein shape
- Can turn protein ON or OFF
- Very common in cell signaling

**Example**: Insulin signaling uses lots of phosphorylation to control blood sugar!

### 2. Methylation

**What happens**: Adding a methyl group (CH₃) to amino acids

**Where**: Usually on lysine or arginine

**Effects**:
- Controls gene expression (on histones)
- Affects protein-protein interactions
- Important for epigenetics!

### 3. Acetylation

**What happens**: Adding an acetyl group to amino acids

**Where**: Usually on lysine

**Effects**:
- Loosens chromatin (on histones)
- Activates some enzymes
- Opposite of methylation effects (sometimes)

### 4. Ubiquitination

**What happens**: Attaching ubiquitin (a small protein) to target protein

**Effects**:
- Tags protein for degradation (recycling)
- Like putting a "trash" label on the protein
- Controls protein lifespan

### 5. Glycosylation

**What happens**: Adding sugar molecules to protein

**Where**: Usually on asparagine or serine/threonine

**Effects**:
- Protects protein from degradation
- Helps protein folding
- Important for cell recognition
- About 50% of human proteins are glycosylated!

### 6. Proteolytic Cleavage

**What happens**: Cutting the protein chain into pieces

**Effects**:
- Activates some proteins (insulin is made this way!)
- Inactivates others
- Removes signaling sequences
- Irreversible (can't be undone)

### Why PTMs Matter

**Creates enormous diversity**:
- One protein can exist in many modified forms
- Different modifications = different functions
- Like having one tool that changes based on attachments!

**Allows rapid regulation**:
- Adding/removing PTMs is faster than making new proteins
- Quick response to signals
- Fine-tuned control

**Examples of PTM importance**:
- **Cancer**: Abnormal phosphorylation drives cancer growth
- **Alzheimer's**: Abnormal protein modifications in brain
- **Diabetes**: Insulin signaling requires proper phosphorylation
- **Aging**: Accumulated protein modifications over time

## Protein Structure and Function

### The Four Levels of Protein Structure

**Primary structure** (1°):
- The sequence of amino acids
- Like letters in a sentence
- Determined by DNA sequence

**Secondary structure** (2°):
- Local folding patterns
- Alpha helices (spiral staircases)
- Beta sheets (zigzag ribbons)
- Held together by hydrogen bonds

**Tertiary structure** (3°):
- Overall 3D shape of one protein chain
- How secondary structures fold together
- The complete 3D structure
- Determines function!

**Quaternary structure** (4°):
- Multiple protein chains together
- Not all proteins have this
- Example: Hemoglobin (4 chains working together)

### Structure = Function

**The 3D shape determines what a protein does**:
- Enzymes have pockets that fit specific molecules
- Antibodies have shapes that recognize specific targets
- Channels have tunnels for specific molecules to pass through

If shape is wrong → protein doesn't work!

**Example**: Sickle cell anemia
- ONE amino acid change in hemoglobin
- Changes protein shape
- Causes red blood cells to become sickle-shaped
- Leads to serious disease

## Techniques in Proteomics

### How Scientists Study Proteins

### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS)

**What it does**: Identifies proteins and measures their amounts

**How it works**:
1. Break proteins into small pieces (peptides)
2. Ionize the peptides (give them a charge)
3. Measure their mass-to-charge ratio
4. Computer identifies which protein it came from

**Like**:
- Weighing puzzle pieces to figure out which puzzle they're from
- Very accurate and sensitive!

**Used for**:
- Identifying proteins in samples
- Measuring protein amounts
- Finding PTMs
- Discovering new proteins

### 2. Protein Microarrays

**What they are**: Chips with thousands of proteins or antibodies

**How they work**:
- Put many different proteins on a chip
- Add your sample
- See which proteins interact with what
- Like a dating app for proteins!

**Used for**:
- Finding protein-protein interactions
- Detecting disease biomarkers
- Drug discovery

### 3. Western Blotting

**What it does**: Detects specific proteins

**How it works**:
1. Separate proteins by size (gel electrophoresis)
2. Transfer to membrane
3. Use antibodies to detect specific protein
4. Like using a highlighter to find one word in a book

**Used for**:
