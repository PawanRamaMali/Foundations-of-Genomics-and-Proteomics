# Epigenetics and Epigenomics

## Chapter Overview

This chapter explores the fascinating world of epigenetics—the study of heritable changes in gene function that occur without alterations to the DNA sequence itself. We'll discover how cells with identical DNA can have vastly different functions, how environmental factors can influence gene expression across generations, and how epigenetic dysregulation contributes to disease. From DNA methylation to histone modifications, from chromatin remodeling to non-coding RNAs, we'll examine the molecular mechanisms that allow organisms to adapt, develop, and respond to their environment.

## Definition and Overview of Epigenetics

### What Is Epigenetics?

**Epigenetics** studies changes in gene activity that DON'T change the DNA sequence itself.

**The word "epigenetic" means**:

- **Epi** = above or on top of

- **Genetic** = relating to genes

- So: "Above genetics" or "On top of genes"

Think of it like:

- DNA = the words in a book

- Epigenetics = highlighting, bookmarks, and notes that change how you read the book

- Same words, but different reading experience!

**More formally**, epigenetics refers to:

- Heritable changes in gene expression or cellular phenotype
- Changes that do not involve alterations to the underlying DNA sequence
- Modifications that can be maintained through cell divisions
- Reversible changes that respond to developmental and environmental cues

**Historical context**:

The term "epigenetics" was coined by Conrad Waddington in 1942 to describe "the interactions of genes with their environment that bring the phenotype into being." Today, it encompasses all molecular mechanisms that regulate gene expression beyond the DNA sequence.

## Difference between Genetics and Epigenetics

Understanding the distinction between genetics and epigenetics is crucial:

### Genetics

**What it is**:

- The study of genes and DNA sequences
- Focuses on the genetic code itself (A, T, G, C)
- Deals with heredity through DNA

**Key characteristics**:

- Changes are typically **permanent** (mutations)
- Follows Mendelian inheritance patterns
- Sequence-based: altering the actual letters of genetic code
- Relatively **stable** throughout life
- Passed from parent to offspring through DNA replication

**Example**: A mutation in the BRCA1 gene sequence increases breast cancer risk—this change is permanent and inherited.

### Epigenetics

**What it is**:

- The study of changes in gene **activity** without changing DNA sequence
- Focuses on chemical modifications to DNA and histones
- Deals with gene expression regulation

**Key characteristics**:

- Changes are potentially **reversible**
- Can be influenced by environment, age, lifestyle, disease
- Modification-based: adding or removing chemical groups
- **Dynamic** and responsive to signals
- Can be passed through cell divisions, sometimes across generations

**Example**: Identical twins have the same DNA, but different epigenetic marks lead to different disease susceptibility—these differences accumulate over time.

### Key Comparisons

| Feature | Genetics | Epigenetics |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **What changes?** | DNA sequence | Gene expression |
| **Permanence** | Usually permanent | Reversible |
| **Inheritance** | Always inherited | Sometimes inherited |
| **Environmental influence** | Minimal | Significant |
| **Therapeutic potential** | Hard to change | Can be targeted by drugs |
| **Stability** | Very stable | Dynamic |

Think of it this way:

- **Genetics** = The hardware (fixed components)
- **Epigenetics** = The software (changeable settings)

## Epigenetic Inheritance and Reversibility

### The Dynamic Nature of Epigenetic Marks

One of the most remarkable features of epigenetic modifications is their **reversibility**, which distinguishes them from genetic mutations.

**Key properties**:

1. **Mitotic inheritance** (cell division):
   - Epigenetic marks are copied when cells divide
   - This allows daughter cells to maintain the same identity as parent cells
   - How liver cells stay liver cells through many divisions
   - Involves maintenance mechanisms that "remember" marks

2. **Meiotic inheritance** (across generations):
   - Most epigenetic marks are **erased** during reproduction
   - Prevents inheritance of temporary environmental responses
   - Ensures each generation starts relatively fresh
   - Some marks escape erasure—this is transgenerational inheritance

3. **Reversibility**:
   - Unlike DNA mutations, epigenetic changes can be reversed
   - Environmental factors can add or remove marks
   - Therapeutic interventions can modify epigenetic states
   - This makes epigenetic changes both a risk and an opportunity

### Types of Epigenetic Inheritance

**Intergenerational inheritance**:

- Direct exposure affects the organism and its developing gametes
- Example: Pregnant woman exposed to famine affects her child (F1) and the child's developing eggs/sperm (F2)
- Not "true" transgenerational—direct exposure occurred

**Transgenerational inheritance**:

- Effects persist beyond F2 generation (F3 and beyond)
- No direct exposure to the original environmental factor
- More controversial in mammals
- Well-documented in plants, worms (C. elegans), and some other organisms

**Evidence in different organisms**:

- **Plants**: Strong evidence for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance
- **C. elegans**: RNA-mediated inheritance can last many generations
- **Mammals**: Most marks erased; rare examples of transgenerational effects
- **Humans**: Limited but growing evidence

**Reprogramming events**:

Two major "epigenetic reset" events occur in mammals:

1. **Zygotic reprogramming**: Just after fertilization
2. **Germline reprogramming**: During germ cell (egg/sperm) development

These erasure events explain why most acquired characteristics are NOT inherited!

### Why Epigenetics Matters

**The Big Question**: If all your cells have the same DNA, why are they different?

- Brain cells and muscle cells have identical DNA

- But they look and act completely different!

- **Answer**: Epigenetics!

Epigenetic marks determine:

- Which genes are turned ON in each cell type

- Which genes are turned OFF

- How cells remember their identity

- How cells respond to the environment

- How development proceeds in an orderly fashion

- How organisms adapt to environmental changes

- How experiences can affect gene expression

- How diseases develop and might be treated

## DNA Methylation

### Adding Chemical Tags to DNA

**DNA methylation** = Adding a methyl group (CH₃) to DNA

**Where it happens**:

- Usually on cytosine (C) bases

- Specifically in "CpG" sequences (C next to G)

- "p" stands for the phosphate between them

**What it looks like**:

- Normal: Cytosine (C)

- Methylated: 5-methylcytosine (5mC)

- Same base, just with a tiny chemical decoration

Think of it like:

- Putting a sticker on a letter

- The letter is still there and readable

- But the sticker changes how it's treated

### CpG Islands and Their Importance

**CpG islands** = Regions with lots of CpG sequences

**Key facts**:

- "CpG" refers to cytosine-phosphate-guanine dinucleotides
- Found near **60-70% of human gene promoters**
- Typically **500-2000 base pairs long**
- High GC content (>50%)
- Usually UN-methylated in normal cells (genes are ready to be expressed)
- If they GET methylated → gene is turned off

**Why "islands"?**

- CpG dinucleotides are relatively rare in most of the genome (~1%)
- They're "depleted" because methylated CpGs mutate over evolutionary time (5mC → T)
- CpG islands are protected regions where CpGs are preserved
- These islands are like oases in a CpG-poor desert

**Location and function**:

- **Promoter CpG islands**: Control gene transcription start sites
- **Intragenic islands**: Found within gene bodies
- **Intergenic islands**: Between genes, may regulate distant genes
- **Shore regions**: Areas flanking CpG islands (up to 2kb away)—often show tissue-specific methylation patterns

**Examples**:

- **Cancer**: Tumor suppressor genes get abnormally methylated → cancer
- **Development**: Methylation patterns change as embryo develops
- **X-inactivation**: Methylation silences one X chromosome in females
- **Aging**: CpG islands gradually lose protection and become methylated

### DNA Methyltransferases (DNMTs)

The enzymes that add methyl groups to DNA are called **DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs)**.

**DNMT1 - The "Maintenance" Methyltransferase**:

- **Function**: Copies methylation patterns during DNA replication
- **How it works**: Recognizes hemi-methylated DNA (one strand methylated)
- **Role**: Maintains existing patterns through cell divisions
- **Specificity**: Prefers hemi-methylated substrates
- **Location**: Associates with replication fork
- **Importance**: Ensures daughter cells inherit same methylation pattern as parent

Think of DNMT1 as a photocopier—it copies existing marks onto new DNA strands!

**DNMT3A and DNMT3B - The "De Novo" Methyltransferases**:

- **Function**: Establish NEW methylation patterns
- **When active**: During development, germ cell formation
- **DNMT3A**: 
  - Active in most tissues
  - Important for somatic cell methylation
  - Mutations cause growth disorders
- **DNMT3B**: 
  - Particularly active in early development
  - Critical for embryonic development
  - Mutations cause ICF syndrome (Immunodeficiency, Centromeric instability, Facial anomalies)
- **Collaboration**: Often work together with DNMT1

Think of DNMT3A/B as architects—they design new methylation patterns from scratch!

**DNMT3L - The Helper**:

- Does NOT have methyltransferase activity itself
- Stimulates DNMT3A and DNMT3B activity
- Critical for establishing maternal imprints
- Mutations cause infertility

**Coordination of DNMTs**:

```
DNA Replication:
Parent DNA: [methylated-C]==========[methylated-C]
               ↓                         ↓
           DNA copied
               ↓
New DNA:    [methylated-C]==========C
            C===========[methylated-C]
               ↓
           DNMT1 acts
               ↓
Daughter:   [methylated-C]===========[methylated-C]
            [methylated-C]===========[methylated-C]
```

### Demethylation and TET Enzymes

For a long time, scientists thought DNA methylation was essentially permanent. Then the **TET enzymes** were discovered!

**TET Enzymes (Ten-Eleven Translocation enzymes)**:

- **TET1, TET2, TET3** - Three family members in mammals
- **Function**: Convert 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC)
- **Result**: First step in active demethylation pathway

**The Demethylation Pathway**:

1. **5mC** (5-methylcytosine)
   ↓ TET enzymes
2. **5hmC** (5-hydroxymethylcytosine)
   ↓ TET enzymes
3. **5fC** (5-formylcytosine)
   ↓ TET enzymes
4. **5caC** (5-carboxylcytosine)
   ↓ TDG enzyme + BER pathway
5. **C** (unmodified cytosine)

**Properties of oxidized methylcytosines**:

- **5hmC**: Not just an intermediate—also has its own regulatory functions
- Enriched in brain tissue and embryonic stem cells
- Can recruit specific protein readers
- May represent a stable epigenetic mark

**Two types of demethylation**:

1. **Active demethylation**:
   - TET-mediated oxidation pathway
   - Can occur rapidly in response to signals
   - Important in development and cell differentiation
   - Critical for paternal genome demethylation in zygote

2. **Passive demethylation**:
   - Occurs when DNMT1 is blocked or absent
   - Methylation lost through DNA replication
   - Slower process
   - Important in some developmental contexts

**TET enzyme importance**:

- **Development**: Essential for zygotic and germline reprogramming
- **Cancer**: TET2 frequently mutated in blood cancers
- **Brain**: High TET1 expression; important for neuronal function
- **Reprogramming**: Critical for iPSC generation

### Effects of DNA Methylation on Gene Expression

**Promoter methylation** → **Gene Silencing**:

**How it works**:

1. **Physical blocking**:
   - Methyl groups prevent transcription factors from binding
   - Like putting a lock on a door

2. **Recruiting silencing complexes**:
   - Methylated DNA attracts methyl-binding domain (MBD) proteins
   - MBD proteins recruit histone deacetylases (HDACs)
   - HDACs remove activating marks from histones
   - Creates compact, inactive chromatin

3. **Creating heterochromatin**:
   - Methylated regions become densely packed
   - Transcription machinery cannot access DNA
   - Gene is stably silenced

**Gene body methylation** → **Variable effects**:

Surprisingly, methylation WITHIN gene bodies can:
- Correlate with **increased** transcription
- Prevent spurious transcription initiation
- Regulate alternative splicing
- Mark actively transcribed genes

**Context-dependent effects**:

| Location | Methylation Level | Effect |
|----------|------------------|---------|
| Promoter CpG islands | High | Strong silencing |
| Gene bodies | High | Often associated with expression |
| Enhancers | High | Reduced activity |
| Repetitive elements | High | Silencing (protective) |
| Imprinted genes | Parent-specific | Monoallelic expression |

### Genomic Imprinting

**Genomic imprinting** = Parent-of-origin-specific gene expression

**Key concept**:

- For most genes, both copies (maternal and paternal) are expressed
- For **imprinted genes**, only ONE copy is expressed
- Which copy is expressed depends on which parent it came from
- The other copy is silenced by DNA methylation

**How it works**:

1. During germ cell formation, specific genes get methylated
2. This methylation is maintained after fertilization
3. Methylated allele is silenced
4. Unmethylated allele is expressed
5. Pattern is reset each generation in the germline

**Why imprinting exists**:

- **Parental conflict hypothesis**: Mother and father have different evolutionary interests
- **Dosage regulation**: Some genes need precise expression levels
- **Brain development**: Many imprinted genes affect behavior and development

**Imprinting disorders**:

- **Prader-Willi syndrome**: Loss of paternal 15q11-13 expression
- **Angelman syndrome**: Loss of maternal 15q11-13 expression
- Same chromosomal region, different diseases depending on parent of origin!

We'll discuss specific examples in detail later in the "Genomic Imprinting" section.

### X-Chromosome Inactivation (XCI)

**The problem**:

- Females have TWO X chromosomes (XX)
- Males have ONE X chromosome (XY)
- How to balance X-linked gene expression?

**The solution**: X-Chromosome Inactivation (XCI)

- One X chromosome in each female cell is **randomly inactivated**
- Occurs early in development
- Inactivated X becomes a **Barr body** (condensed, silent chromatin)
- Same X remains inactive in all descendant cells

**Role of DNA methylation in XCI**:

1. **Initiation**: Guided by XIST lncRNA (more on this later)
2. **Spreading**: Silencing spreads along the chromosome
3. **Maintenance**: DNA methylation LOCKS in the silent state
4. **Stability**: Methylation ensures X remains inactive through divisions

**Methylation patterns**:

- CpG islands on inactive X become heavily methylated
- This stabilizes the inactive state
- Active X remains unmethylated
- Pattern is mitotically heritable

**Clinical significance**:

- X-linked diseases can have variable severity in females
- Depends on which X is inactivated in each cell
- Random inactivation creates mosaic pattern

We'll explore the molecular mechanisms in greater detail in the dedicated "X-Chromosome Inactivation" section.

## Histone Modifications

### Decorating the Histone Proteins

Remember histones? DNA wraps around them like thread on spools.

**Histone modifications** = Adding or removing chemical groups to histone proteins

**Where modifications occur**:

- Histone "tails" sticking out from nucleosomes

- Like ribbons on wrapped presents

- These tails are accessible to modifying enzymes

- Rich in lysine (K), arginine (R), serine (S), and threonine (T) residues

### Types of Histone Modifications

**1. Acetylation** (adding acetyl groups):

- **Effect**: Loosens chromatin, gene activation

- **Where**: Lysine amino acids

- **Think of it as**: Opening the curtains to let in light

**2. Methylation** (adding methyl groups):

- **Effect**: Can activate OR repress genes (depends on location!)

- **Where**: Lysine or arginine amino acids

- **Complex**: Different methylation patterns mean different things

**3. Phosphorylation** (adding phosphate groups):

- **Effect**: Various effects depending on location

- **Important for**: Cell division, DNA repair

**4. Ubiquitination** (adding ubiquitin protein):

- **Effect**: Can activate or repress genes

- **Also can**: Mark histones for degradation

### Histone Acetylation in Detail

**Histone Acetyltransferases (HATs)**:

**What they do**:
- Add acetyl groups (-COCH₃) to lysine residues
- **Neutralize positive charge** on histones
- Weaken histone-DNA interaction
- Open up chromatin structure
- Generally → **Gene activation**

**Major HAT families**:

1. **GNAT family** (Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferases):
   - Gcn5, PCAF
   - Often part of large complexes
   - Acetylate H3 and H4

2. **MYST family**:
   - MOZ, MOF, TIP60
   - Important in development
   - Some mutations cause cancer

3. **p300/CBP family**:
   - Broad substrate specificity
   - Act as transcriptional co-activators
   - Integrate multiple signaling pathways

**Histone Deacetylases (HDACs)**:

**What they do**:
- Remove acetyl groups from lysines
- Restore positive charge on histones
- Strengthen histone-DNA binding
- Condense chromatin
- Generally → **Gene repression**

**HDAC classes**:

1. **Class I HDACs** (HDAC1, 2, 3, 8):
   - Found mainly in nucleus
   - Related to yeast Rpd3
   - Broadly expressed

2. **Class II HDACs** (HDAC4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10):
   - Can shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm
   - Tissue-specific expression
   - Regulated by cellular signals

3. **Class III HDACs** (Sirtuins: SIRT1-7):
   - NAD⁺-dependent (different mechanism)
   - Involved in aging and metabolism
   - Connected to caloric restriction effects

4. **Class IV HDACs** (HDAC11):
   - Shares features of Class I and II
   - Least studied

**Balance is key**:

```
   HATs          HDACs
    ↓              ↓
Acetylation ←→ Deacetylation
    ↓              ↓
Open chromatin  Closed chromatin
    ↓              ↓
Active genes    Silent genes
```

**Clinical relevance**:
- HDAC inhibitors are approved cancer drugs
- Work by reactivating silenced tumor suppressor genes
- Examples: Vorinostat, Romidepsin

### Histone Methylation in Detail

**Histone Methyltransferases (HMTs)**:

**Complexity**:
- Can add 1, 2, or 3 methyl groups (mono-, di-, tri-methylation)
- Different degrees of methylation have different meanings
- Different lysines can be methylated (K4, K9, K27, K36, K79)

**Major HMTs**:

1. **SET domain-containing HMTs**:
   - Largest family
   - MLL, NSD, SET1/2, SUV39H, G9a, EZH2
   
2. **Non-SET domain HMTs**:
   - DOT1L (methylates H3K79)
   - Uses different mechanism

**Key methylation marks**:

**Activating marks**:
- **H3K4me3** (Histone 3, Lysine 4, tri-methylation):
  - Found at active promoters
  - Mark of active transcription
  - Added by MLL complexes
  
- **H3K36me3** (Histone 3, Lysine 36, tri-methylation):
  - Found in gene bodies
  - Mark of active transcription elongation
  - Prevents cryptic transcription

**Repressive marks**:
- **H3K9me3** (Histone 3, Lysine 9, tri-methylation):
  - Found in heterochromatin
  - Added by SUV39H enzymes
  - Creates binding sites for HP1 protein
  - Maintains gene silencing
  
- **H3K27me3** (Histone 3, Lysine 27, tri-methylation):
  - Added by PRC2 complex (contains EZH2)
  - Important for development
  - Silences developmental genes
  - Maintains cell identity

**H3K9 methylation pathway**:

```
Unmethylated H3K9
      ↓ G9a/GLP (euchromatic regions)
H3K9me1/me2
      ↓ SUV39H (heterochromatic regions)
H3K9me3
      ↓ Recruits HP1
Heterochromatin formation
      ↓
Gene silencing
```

**Histone Demethylases (KDMs)**:

Yes, histone methylation is reversible too!

**Two families**:

1. **LSD family** (Lysine-Specific Demethylases):
   - LSD1/KDM1A, LSD2/KDM1B
   - Remove mono- and di-methyl groups
   - FAD-dependent enzymes
   - Cannot remove tri-methyl groups

2. **JmjC domain-containing demethylases**:
   - Many family members (KDM2-KDM8)
   - Can remove all methylation states (me1, me2, me3)
   - Iron and α-ketoglutarate-dependent
   - More versatile than LSDs

**Example - LSD1**:
- Removes H3K4me1/me2 (activating marks) → repression
- Can also remove H3K9me1/me2 (repressive marks) → activation
- Context-dependent function
- Targeted by drugs for cancer treatment

### Other Important Histone Modifications

**Phosphorylation**:

**Key marks**:
- **H3S10ph** (Histone 3, Serine 10, phosphorylation):
  - Added during mitosis
  - Chromosome condensation
  - Also involved in gene activation
  
- **H2AXS139ph** (γH2AX):
  - Mark of DNA damage
  - Recruits DNA repair machinery
  - Spreads megabases from break site

**Function**:
- Rapid and reversible
- Kinases add phosphate groups
- Phosphatases remove them
- Often cross-talks with other modifications

**Ubiquitination**:

**H2AK119ub1** (H2A, Lysine 119, monoubiquitination):
- Added by PRC1 complex
- Gene repression
- Works with H3K27me3
- Part of Polycomb silencing system

**H2BK120ub1** (H2B, Lysine 120, monoubiquitination):
- Gene activation!
- Required for H3K4 and H3K79 methylation
- Trans-histone regulation
- Important for transcription elongation

**Sumoylation**:

- Addition of SUMO proteins (Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifiers)
- Generally associated with transcriptional repression
- Less well understood than other modifications
- Can compete with acetylation at same lysines

**ADP-ribosylation**:

- Addition of ADP-ribose groups
- Catalyzed by PARP enzymes
- Important for DNA damage response
- Can modify core histones and H1

### The Histone Code Hypothesis

**The "histone code" hypothesis**:

- Different combinations of modifications send different signals

- Like a complex language written on histones

- Specific proteins "read" these marks and respond accordingly

**The code concept**:

```
Histone tail:  [K4]---[K9]---[K14]---[K18]---[K27]
Modifications:  me3    ac     ac      ac      me3
Meaning:      "Bivalent promoter - poised for activation"

vs.

Histone tail:  [K4]---[K9]---[K14]---[K18]---[K27]
Modifications:  me1    me3    -       -       -
Meaning:      "Heterochromatin - permanently silenced"
```

**Reader proteins**:

Different protein domains recognize specific modifications:

1. **Bromodomains**:
   - Recognize acetylated lysines
   - Found in HATs, chromatin remodelers, transcription factors
   - Example: BRD4 reads H3K27ac and H4K5ac

2. **Chromodomains**:
   - Recognize methylated lysines
   - Found in HP1 (reads H3K9me3)
   - Found in Polycomb proteins

3. **PHD fingers**:
   - Recognize H3K4me3 and H3K4me0
   - Found in many chromatin proteins
   - Can distinguish methylation states

4. **Tudor domains**:
   - Recognize methylated arginines and lysines
   - Found in multiple protein families

5. **MBT domains**:
   - Recognize mono- and di-methylated lysines
   - Found in Polycomb proteins

**Combinatorial complexity**:

- Over 100 different histone modifications identified
- Multiple modifications can occur on same histone tail
- Modifications can influence each other (cross-talk)
- Creates enormous information-coding capacity
- Context matters: same mark, different location = different meaning

**Examples of histone codes**:

| Code | Meaning | Location |
|------|---------|----------|
| H3K4me3 + H3K27me3 | Bivalent/poised | ES cell genes |
| H3K4me3 + H3K9ac + H3K27ac | Active transcription | Active promoters |
| H3K9me3 + H4K20me3 | Constitutive heterochromatin | Repetitive DNA |
| H3K27me3 + H2AK119ub1 | Polycomb silencing | Developmental genes |
| H3K36me3 | Transcription elongation | Gene bodies |

Think of it like:

- Different emoji combinations convey different meanings

- Cells "read" histone modifications to know what to do

- 😊 + 👍 = approval, but 😊 + 😏 = sarcasm!

- Similarly, H3K4me3 + H3K27ac = activate, but H3K4me3 + H3K27me3 = pause

**Evidence and limitations**:

**Supporting evidence**:
- Specific modifications correlate with specific chromatin states
- Reader proteins bind modifications and recruit effector proteins
- Removing modifications changes gene expression predictably

**Limitations and debates**:
- Not all modification combinations have been tested
- Same modifications can have different effects in different contexts
- Some argue it's more about "histone language" than strict "code"
- Redundancy exists—different marks can have similar effects

## Chromatin Structure and Remodeling

### Understanding Chromatin States

Chromatin is not uniform throughout the nucleus—it exists in different states of compaction that directly affect gene expression.

### Euchromatin vs Heterochromatin

**Euchromatin** ("true chromatin"):

**Characteristics**:
- **Loosely packed** chromatin
- **Light-staining** under microscope
- **Transcriptionally active** (genes can be expressed)
- Rich in genes
- Associated with activating histone marks (H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K27ac)
- Typically unmethylated or hypomethylated DNA
- Accessible to transcription factors

**Location**:
- Interior of nucleus
- Gene-rich chromosomal regions
- Active during interphase

Think of euchromatin as **open library stacks**—books (genes) are accessible and can be read.

**Heterochromatin** ("different chromatin"):

**Characteristics**:
- **Tightly packed** chromatin
- **Dark-staining** under microscope
- **Transcriptionally silent** (genes cannot be expressed)
- Gene-poor
- Associated with repressive marks (H3K9me3, H3K27me3, H4K20me3)
- Highly methylated DNA
- Inaccessible to transcription factors

**Two types**:

1. **Constitutive heterochromatin**:
   - Always condensed, all cell types
   - Found at centromeres and telomeres
   - Contains repetitive DNA
   - Structural role
   - Examples: Centromeric repeats, satellite DNA
   - Never transcribed (except specialized RNAs)

2. **Facultative heterochromatin**:
   - Can switch between hetero- and euchromatin
   - Cell type-specific and developmentally regulated
   - Contains genes that CAN be expressed in some contexts
   - Examples: Inactive X chromosome, imprinted genes, tissue-specific silent genes
   - Reversible condensation

Think of heterochromatin as **locked library storage**—books exist but can't be accessed.

**Comparison table**:

| Feature | Euchromatin | Heterochromatin |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Compaction** | Loose | Tight |
| **Staining** | Light | Dark |
| **Transcription** | Active | Silent |
| **DNA methylation** | Low | High |
| **Histone marks** | H3K4me3, H3ac | H3K9me3, H4K20me3 |
| **Replication timing** | Early S phase | Late S phase |
| **Gene density** | High | Low |
| **Accessibility** | High | Low |
| **Location** | Nuclear interior | Nuclear periphery, nucleolus |

**Transitions between states**:

During development and differentiation:
```
Euchromatin ←→ Facultative Heterochromatin
     ↑                    ↑
  (Active)           (Silenced)
     ↑                    ↑
  Gene ON              Gene OFF
```

Constitutive heterochromatin remains stable:
```
Constitutive Heterochromatin (永远 always silenced)
```

### Nucleosome Positioning

**Nucleosome** = DNA wrapped around histone octamer

**Positioning matters**:

- **Where** nucleosomes sit affects gene expression
- **How tightly** DNA wraps affects accessibility
- **Spacing** between nucleosomes matters

**Key regions**:

1. **Nucleosome-Free Regions (NFRs)**:
   - Found at promoters and enhancers
   - Typically 150-200 bp
   - Allow transcription factor binding
   - Mark of active regulatory elements

2. **+1 nucleosome**:
   - First nucleosome downstream of transcription start site (TSS)
   - Often contains H3.3 variant
   - Precisely positioned
   - Marks active genes

3. **-1 nucleosome**:
   - Nucleosome just upstream of TSS
   - Flanks promoter NFR
   - Often has H2A.Z variant

**Determinants of positioning**:

1. **DNA sequence**:
   - Some sequences favor nucleosome formation
   - AT-rich sequences are more flexible
   - Poly(dA:dT) tracts resist nucleosomes
   - Creates intrinsic positioning preferences

2. **Trans-acting factors**:
   - Transcription factors
   - Chromatin remodelers (see below)
   - Pioneer factors that can bind nucleosomal DNA

3. **Histone variants**:
   - H2A.Z, H3.3, H2A.Bbd alter stability
   - Affect positioning and dynamics

4. **Boundary elements**:
   - Insulator proteins (like CTCF)
   - Create barriers to nucleosome spreading

**Dynamic nucleosome landscape**:

```
Inactive gene:
[Nuc][Nuc][Nuc][Nuc][Nuc][Promoter buried][Nuc][Nuc]

↓ Activation signal

Active gene:
[Nuc][Nuc]------[NFR]------[+1]--[Nuc]--[Nuc]--[Nuc]
                 ↑          ↑
             TF binding   TSS
```

### ATP-Dependent Chromatin Remodeling Complexes

**Chromatin remodeling** = Moving, removing, or changing nucleosomes

**Chromatin remodeling complexes** are molecular machines that:

- Slide nucleosomes along DNA
- Eject nucleosomes completely
- Replace histones with variants
- Loosen or tighten chromatin
- Use ATP energy to do so

**Effects**:

- Make DNA accessible (gene ON)
- Make DNA inaccessible (gene OFF)
- Respond to cellular signals

Think of chromatin remodeling like:

- Rearranging furniture to access different parts of a room
- Opening or closing window blinds
- Making space for activities

### Major Remodeling Complex Families

```
1. Signal received
   ↓
2. Transcription factors bind
   ↓
3. HATs recruited → Acetylation
   ↓
4. SWI/SNF recruited → Nucleosome ejection
   ↓
5. Pol II recruited → Transcription begins
   ↓
6. CHD1 recruited by H3K4me3 → Maintains open state
   ↓
7. ISWI organizes nucleosomes in gene body
```

## Non-Coding RNA-Mediated Regulation

### RNA Molecules That Control Genes

Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play crucial roles in epigenetic regulation! Unlike mRNA that codes for proteins, these RNAs have regulatory functions.

**Key concept**: ncRNAs guide, recruit, and regulate epigenetic machinery to specific genomic locations.

### MicroRNAs (miRNAs)

**What they are**:

- Small RNA molecules (~22 nucleotides long)
- Single-stranded
- Evolutionarily conserved
- Over 2,000 miRNAs in humans

**How they're made**:

1. **Transcription**: 
   - RNA Pol II transcribes pri-miRNA (primary miRNA)
   - Can be from intergenic regions or introns

2. **Nuclear processing**:
   - Drosha enzyme cuts pri-miRNA → pre-miRNA (~70 nt hairpin)
   - DGCR8 protein helps Drosha recognize correct sites

3. **Export**:
   - Exportin-5 transports pre-miRNA to cytoplasm

4. **Cytoplasmic processing**:
   - Dicer enzyme cuts pre-miRNA → mature miRNA duplex
   - One strand selected as guide strand

5. **RISC assembly**:
   - Guide strand loaded into RISC (RNA-Induced Silencing Complex)
   - Argonaute (AGO) protein is catalytic component

**What they do**:

- Bind to complementary sequences in mRNA (usually 3' UTR)
- **Perfect match**: mRNA cleavage (rare in animals)
- **Imperfect match**: Translation repression (common)
- **Both**: mRNA degradation

**Result**: Reduced protein production without changing DNA

**Epigenetic aspects**:

1. **They regulate epigenetic enzymes**:
   - miR-29 family targets DNMTs → DNA demethylation
   - miR-101 targets EZH2 → reduced H3K27me3

### ncRNA Coordination

**Regulatory networks**:

ncRNAs don't work in isolation:

1. **lncRNAs can be processed into miRNAs**:
   - H19 → miR-675
   - MIR100HG → miR-100, let-7, miR-125

2. **miRNAs regulate lncRNA expression**:

```

## Epigenetic Control of Gene Expression

### How Epigenetic Mechanisms Regulate Transcription

Epigenetic mechanisms don't work in isolation—they coordinate to control when, where, and how much genes are expressed.

### Promoter Silencing and Activation

**Promoters** = DNA sequences where transcription begins

**Active promoter characteristics**:

1. **Open chromatin**:
   - Nucleosome-free region (NFR) at TSS
   - Accessible to transcription factors
   - DNase/ATAC-seq hypersensitive

2. **Activating histone marks**:
   - H3K4me3 (strong signal)
   - H3K9ac, H3K27ac
   - H3K4me1 (at some promoters)

3. **Unmethylated DNA**:
   - CpG island typically unmethylated
   - Allows transcription factor binding

4. **Bound transcription factors**:
   - Can recruit HATs
   - Can recruit chromatin remodelers
   - Initiate transcription

**Silenced promoter characteristics**:

1. **Closed chromatin**:
   - Nucleosomes positioned over TSS
   - Inaccessible to transcription factors
   - Compact structure

2. **Repressive histone marks**:
   - H3K27me3 (facultative silencing)
   - H3K9me3 (constitutive silencing)
   - Deacetylated histones

3. **Methylated DNA**:
   - CpG island methylated
   - Blocks transcription factor binding
   - Recruits MBD proteins and repressors

4. **Repressive complexes**:
   - PRC2/PRC1 (Polycomb)
   - HP1 proteins
   - HDACs

**Transition between states**:

```
SILENT PROMOTER:
Methylated DNA, H3K27me3, positioned nucleosomes
                ↓
           Activation signal
                ↓
Step 1: Pioneer factors bind (can access nucleosomal DNA)
Step 2: Recruit TET enzymes → DNA demethylation
Step 3: Recruit HATs → Histone acetylation
Step 4: Recruit chromatin remodelers → Nucleosome eviction
Step 5: H3K4 methyltransferases → H3K4me3 deposition
Step 6: Transcription factors bind
Step 7: RNA Pol II recruited
                ↓
ACTIVE PROMOTER:
Unmethylated DNA, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, open chromatin, active transcription
```

### Enhancers, Insulators, and Boundary Elements

**Enhancers**:

**What they are**:
- Regulatory DNA sequences
- Activate transcription from a distance
- Can be 10 kb or more from target gene
- Can be upstream, downstream, or in introns

**Epigenetic signatures of active enhancers**:

1. **H3K4me1** (mono-methylation):
   - Marks both active and poised enhancers
   - Distinguish from promoters (which have H3K4me3)

2. **H3K27ac** (acetylation):
   - Marks ACTIVE enhancers specifically
   - Poised enhancers lack this mark

3. **Open chromatin**:
   - DNase/ATAC-seq accessible
   - Nucleosome-depleted regions

4. **Bound transcription factors**:
   - Cell-type specific
   - Often clustered ("enhancer clusters")

5. **Enhancer RNAs (eRNAs)**:
   - Transcribed from active enhancers
   - Mark of enhancer activity

**Enhancer states**:

| State | H3K4me1 | H3K27ac | Activity |
|-------|---------|---------|----------|
| **Active** | + | + | Actively enhancing |
| **Poised** | + | - | Ready to activate |
| **Primed** | + | - | Developmental potential |
| **Inactive** | - | - | Not functional |

**Super-enhancers**:
- Clusters of enhancers
- Very high levels of H3K27ac
- Drive cell identity genes
- Enriched for disease-associated variants
- Often dysregulated in cancer

**Enhancer-promoter interactions**:

Physical contact through DNA looping:
```
Enhancer ----[looping]---- Promoter
  ↑                           ↑
H3K27ac                    H3K4me3
TF bound                   Pol II

      Mediator complex
      Cohesin complex
```

**Insulators** (Boundary elements):

**What they are**:
- DNA sequences that block interactions
- Create boundaries between chromatin domains
- Prevent inappropriate enhancer-promoter contacts

**CTCF** - Master insulator protein:

**Functions**:
1. **Enhancer blocking**:
   - Prevents enhancers from activating wrong genes
   - Creates regulatory boundaries

2. **Barrier function**:
   - Blocks spread of heterochromatin
   - Maintains euchromatin/heterochromatin boundaries

3. **Chromatin organization**:
   - Anchors chromatin loops
   - Organizes TADs (Topologically Associated Domains)

4. **Imprinting control**:
   - Regulates parent-specific expression
   - Critical for imprinting centers

**CTCF mechanism**:

```
Enhancer [----CTCF----] Gene A    Gene B

Without CTCF:
Enhancer activates both Gene A and Gene B

With CTCF:
Enhancer ----| CTCF barrier
             ↓
Only Gene A activated
Gene B insulated
```

**Epigenetic regulation of CTCF**:

- **DNA methylation blocks CTCF binding**
  - Methylation at CTCF sites → loss of insulation
  - Important for imprinting control
  - Used at some imprinted loci

- **Example - H19/Igf2 locus**:
  - CTCF binds unmethylated ICR
  - Blocks Igf2 enhancer access
  - Methylation of ICR blocks CTCF
  - Allows Igf2 activation

### Role of Transcription Factors and Cofactors

**Transcription factors (TFs)**:

**Pioneer factors**:
- Can bind to nucleosomal DNA
- First factors to access closed chromatin
- Recruit chromatin remodelers
- Examples: FoxA, GATA, PU.1, Oct4

**Sequence-specific TFs**:
- Recognize specific DNA motifs
- Recruit coactivators or corepressors
- Integrate multiple signals

**Epigenetic TF interactions**:

1. **TFs recruit epigenetic modifiers**:
   - HATs/HDACs
   - Methyltransferases
   - Chromatin remodelers

2. **Epigenetic state affects TF binding**:
   - Open chromatin → easier binding
   - DNA methylation → blocks binding
   - Some TFs require specific histone marks

3. **Positive feedback loops**:
   ```
   TF binds → Recruits HAT → Acetylation →
   → More TFs bind → More acetylation →
   → Stable active state
   ```

**Coactivators**:

**p300/CBP**:
- HAT activity
- Platform for multiple factors
- Integrates signals from many TFs
- Often rate-limiting for activation

**Mediator complex**:
- Large complex (>30 subunits)
- Bridge between enhancers and promoters
- Interacts with RNA Pol II
- Required for most transcription

**TIP60/NuA4**:
- HAT complex
- Activates transcription
- DNA damage response

**Corepressors**:

**NCoR/SMRT**:
- Recruit HDACs
- Mediate transcriptional repression
- Nuclear receptor corepressors

**NuRD complex**:
- Contains CHD3/4 (remodeler) + HDAC1/2
- Both remodeling and deacetylation
- Gene silencing

**CtBP (C-terminal Binding Protein)**:
- Recruits HDACs and HMTs
- Mediates repression by many TFs

### Polycomb and Trithorax Systems

Two ancient opposing systems that maintain cell identity:

**Polycomb Group (PcG) Proteins** - The Silencers:

**PRC2 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)**:
- **Catalytic subunit**: EZH2 (or EZH1)
- **Activity**: Deposits H3K27me3
- **Function**: Initiates silencing
- **Targets**: Developmental genes

**PRC1 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)**:
- **Activity**: Ubiquitinates H2A (H2AK119ub1)
- **Function**: Maintains/reinforces silencing
- **Can**: Compact chromatin
- **Recruitment**: By H3K27me3 or DNA binding

**Polycomb mechanism**:
```
Development signal
    ↓
PRC2 recruited to gene
    ↓
H3K27me3 deposited
    ↓
PRC1 recruited
    ↓
H2AK119ub1 added
    ↓
Chromatin compaction
    ↓
Gene stably silenced
    ↓
Maintained through cell divisions
```

**Trithorax Group (TrxG) Proteins** - The Activators:

**MLL complexes** (Mixed Lineage Leukemia):
- **Activity**: Deposit H3K4me3
- **Function**: Maintain active state
- **Oppose**: Polycomb silencing

**Function**: 
- Keep developmental genes ON
- Maintain differentiated state
- Remember activation decisions

**Balance determines fate**:
```
Stem cells:
Many genes have BOTH H3K4me3 AND H3K27me3
→ "Bivalent" state
→ Poised for activation OR silencing

Differentiation:
Cell type A:
Gene X: H3K4me3 only → Active
Gene Y: H3K27me3 only → Silent

Cell type B:
Gene X: H3K27me3 only → Silent
Gene Y: H3K4me3 only → Active
```

**Clinical significance**:
- EZH2 overexpressed in many cancers
- MLL translocations cause leukemia
- Therapeutic targets

### Techniques in Epigenomics

**1. Bisulfite Sequencing**:

- Detects DNA methylation

- Treats DNA with bisulfite (changes unmethylated C to U)

- Methylated C stays as C

- Sequence and compare!

**2. ChIP-seq** (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation + Sequencing):

- Detects histone modifications

- Uses antibodies to pull down modified histones

- Sequence the attached DNA

- Map where modifications are genome-wide

**3. ATAC-seq** (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin):

- Finds open (accessible) chromatin regions

- Open chromatin = active genes

- Closed chromatin = silenced genes

## Differences in Prokaryotic vs. Eukaryotic Epigenomes

### Prokaryotes: Limited Epigenetics

**Prokaryotes have**:

- DNA methylation (but different purposes)

- No histones (so no histone modifications)

- Simpler regulation

**Prokaryotic methylation**:

- Protects DNA from restriction enzymes

- Helps DNA replication timing

- Some gene regulation

### Eukaryotes: Complex Epigenetics

**Eukaryotes have**:

- Extensive DNA methylation

- Many histone modifications

- Chromatin remodeling

- Non-coding RNAs

- Complex epigenetic inheritance

**Why the difference?**

- Eukaryotes need more sophisticated regulation

- Multicellular organisms need cell type identity

- Complex development requires epigenetic memory

## Epigenetics and Environment

### Nature AND Nurture

Epigenetics is the bridge between genes and environment!

**Environmental factors that affect epigenetics**:

- **Diet**: Nutrients affect methylation patterns

- **Stress**: Changes chromatin structure

- **Toxins**: Can alter epigenetic marks

- **Exercise**: Modifies histones in muscle

- **Social interaction**: Affects brain epigenetics

**Famous examples**:

**1. Dutch Hunger Winter (1944-1945)**:

- Pregnant women experienced famine

- Their children had epigenetic changes

- These changes persisted into adulthood

- Even affected grandchildren!

**2. Agouti Mouse Experiment**:

- Mother mice fed different diets

- Offspring had different coat colors

- Same genes, different epigenetic marks!

- Diet changed epigenetics, which changed appearance

**3. Bee Development**:

- Queen bees and worker bees have identical DNA

- Different diets (royal jelly vs. regular food)

- Different epigenetic patterns

- Completely different bodies and behaviors!

## Epigenetic Inheritance

### Passing On More Than Just DNA

Can epigenetic marks be inherited? **Sometimes, YES!**

### Types of Epigenetic Inheritance

**1. Mitotic inheritance** (cell division):

- Epigenetic marks copied when cells divide

- How liver cells stay liver cells

- Normal and common!

**2. Transgenerational inheritance** (across generations):

- Some epigenetic marks passed from parent to offspring

- More controversial

- Happens in plants and worms

- Rare in mammals

**Reset mechanisms**:

- Most epigenetic marks are erased during reproduction

- Prevents inheriting temporary changes

- Some marks escape erasure!

## Epigenetics and Disease

### When Epigenetics Goes Wrong

**Cancer**:

- Abnormal DNA methylation

- Tumor suppressor genes get silenced

- Oncogenes get activated

- Epigenetic drugs can help!

**Developmental Disorders**:

- Imprinting disorders (Prader-Willi, Angelman syndromes)

- Rett syndrome (affects histone modifications)

- Fragile X syndrome (abnormal methylation)

**Aging**:

- Epigenetic marks change with age

- "Epigenetic clock" can predict biological age

- Some age-related changes are reversible!

**Neurological Disorders**:

- Alzheimer's disease

- Depression (responds to environment via epigenetics)

- Addiction (epigenetic changes in brain)

## Epigenetic Therapies

### Reversing Epigenetic Changes

Unlike DNA mutations, epigenetic changes are **potentially reversible**!

**Epigenetic drugs**:

- **DNMT inhibitors**: Block DNA methylation

- **HDAC inhibitors**: Affect histone acetylation

- Already used to treat some cancers!

**Future therapies**:

- Editing epigenetic marks precisely

- Reversing age-related changes

- Treating complex diseases

## Epigenetic Reprogramming

### Resetting the Epigenetic Landscape

**Epigenetic reprogramming** = Widespread erasure and re-establishment of epigenetic marks

This is essential for development and can be induced for research/therapeutic purposes.

### Germline Reprogramming

**When it happens**: During formation of sperm and eggs (gametogenesis)

**Why it's necessary**:
- Erase somatic cell epigenetic patterns
- Reset for totipotency
- Establish sex-specific imprints
- Prepare for next generation

**Timeline in mammals**:

**1. Primordial Germ Cell (PGC) Specification** (E6.5-E7.25 in mice):
- Cells destined to become gametes specified
- Still retain somatic epigenetic marks

**2. Migration Phase** (E7.5-E10.5):
- PGCs migrate to developing gonads
- Begin losing DNA methylation

**3. Major Reprogramming** (E10.5-E13.5):
- **Massive DNA demethylation**:
  - Global loss of DNA methylation
  - Down to ~10% of normal levels
  - Most CpG islands demethylated
  - Imprints erased
- **Histone modification changes**:
  - Loss of repressive marks
  - H3K9me2 reduction
  - H3K27me3 preserved at some regions
- **Chromatin remodeling**:
  - More open chromatin state
  - Increased accessibility

**4. Re-methylation** (sex-specific):

**In males (prospermatogonia)**:
- Begins at E14.5
- Continues post-natally
- Establishes paternal imprints
- Methylation of repetitive elements

**In females (oocytes)**:
- Begins at birth (in humans, in utero)
- Continues during oocyte growth
- Establishes maternal imprints
- Different pattern from sperm

**Mechanisms of germline demethylation**:

1. **TET-mediated oxidation**:
   - TET1 and TET2 highly expressed
   - Convert 5mC → 5hmC → 5fC → 5caC
   - Base excision repair removes modified bases

2. **Passive dilution**:
   - PGC proliferation without maintenance methylation
   - Dilutes existing marks through replication

3. **Active demethylation**:
   - TDG-mediated base excision repair
   - Removes oxidized methylcytosines

**Importance**:
- Prevents transgenerational inheritance of acquired marks (mostly)
- Resets cellular potential
- Allows each generation to start fresh
- Some marks escape erasure (transgenerational epigenetic inheritance)

**Marks that escape reprogramming**:
- Some transposable element methylation
- Some imprinted genes (depends on locus)
- Basis for transgenerational inheritance
- More common in plants and invertebrates

### Zygotic Reprogramming (During Embryogenesis)

**When it happens**: Shortly after fertilization

**Why it's necessary**:
- Transition from gamete to embryo
- Establish totipotency
- Prepare for development
- Different from germline reprogramming in several ways

**Asymmetric reprogramming**:

**Paternal genome (from sperm)**:
- **Rapid, active demethylation**
- Occurs within hours of fertilization
- TET3-mediated oxidation
- 5mC → 5hmC → 5fC → 5caC
- Protamines replaced with histones
- Most methylation lost by pronuclear stage

**Maternal genome (from egg)**:
- **Slower, passive demethylation**
- Lost during DNA replication
- DNMT1 excluded from nucleus (some embryos)
- Gradual loss over cleavage divisions
- Some methylation persists longer

**Timeline (in mammals)**:

```
Fertilization
    ↓
Hours 0-6: Paternal active demethylation (TET3)
    ↓
Day 1-4: Maternal passive demethylation
    ↓
Day 3-4: Morula stage, minimal methylation (~10%)
    ↓
Day 4-6: Blastocyst, begin re-methylation
    ↓
Day 6+: Implantation, lineage-specific methylation
    ↓
Gastrulation: Establish somatic methylation patterns
```

**De novo methylation in embryo**:

- Begins at blastocyst stage
- DNMT3A and DNMT3B active
- DNMT3L helps in some regions
- Establishes embryonic patterns
- Lineage-specific differences emerge

**Regions protected from reprogramming**:

1. **Imprinted genes**:
   - Maintain parent-of-origin-specific methylation
   - Protected from both germline and zygotic reprogramming
   - Essential for normal development

2. **Some repetitive elements**:
   - IAPs (Intracisternal A Particles) in mice
   - Remain methylated
   - Genomic defense mechanism

3. **Some CpG islands**:
   - Housekeeping genes
   - Essential genes

**Histone modifications during reprogramming**:

- Sperm chromatin: Mostly protamines, some histones
- Rapid histone incorporation after fertilization
- H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 re-established
- Bivalent domains form in ES cells

### Induced Pluripotency (iPSCs)

**What it is**: Reprogramming somatic cells back to stem cell state

**Discovery**: Shinya Yamanaka, 2006 (Nobel Prize 2012)

**The Yamanaka Factors** - Four transcription factors:
1. **Oct4** (Octamer-binding transcription factor 4)
2. **Sox2** (Sex determining region Y-box 2)
3. **Klf4** (Kruppel-like factor 4)
4. **c-Myc** (Cellular Myc)

**How it works**:

**Initial phase** (Days 0-3):
- Forced expression of OSKM factors
- Changes in cell morphology
- Metabolic shift
- MET (Mesenchymal-Epithelial Transition)

**Intermediate phase** (Days 3-9):
- Stochastic gene expression changes
- Some cells begin reprogramming
- Many cells fail or senesce
- Low efficiency (~0.1-1%)

**Maturation phase** (Days 9-15+):
- Endogenous pluripotency genes activated
- Oct4/Sox2/Nanog expression from endogenous loci
- Exogenous factors no longer needed
- iPSC colonies form

**Epigenetic changes during reprogramming**:

1. **DNA demethylation**:
   - Promoters of pluripotency genes demethylated
   - TET enzymes activated
   - Gradual global changes

2. **Histone modifications**:
   - Loss of differentiation-associated marks
   - Gain of ES cell marks
   - H3K4me3 at pluripotency genes
   - Bivalent domains re-established

3. **Chromatin remodeling**:
   - More open chromatin
   - Nucleosome repositioning
   - Changes in TAD structure

4. **X-reactivation** (in female cells):
   - Inactive X can reactivate
   - XIST silenced
   - Both X chromosomes active (like ES cells)

**Barriers to reprogramming**:

1. **Epigenetic memory**:
   - Somatic methylation patterns
   - Silenced pluripotency genes
   - Hard to erase

2. **Senescence**:
   - p53/p21 pathway activation
   - Cell cycle arrest
   - Prevents transformation

3. **Apoptosis**:
   - Stress response
   - Many cells die

**Enhancing reprogramming**:

- Vitamin C (enhances TET activity)
- HDAC inhibitors (Valproic acid)
- Demethylating agents (limited use)
- Replace c-Myc with safer factors
- Small molecules instead of factors

**Applications**:

1. **Disease modeling**:
   - Generate patient-specific cells
   - Study disease mechanisms
   - Drug screening

2. **Regenerative medicine**:
   - Personalized cell therapies
   - Avoid immune rejection
   - Generate replacement tissues

3. **Basic research**:
   - Study cell fate decisions
   - Understand pluripotency
   - Model development

**Challenges**:

- Incomplete reprogramming
- Epigenetic memory persists
- Genomic instability risk
- Tumor formation risk
- Efficiency still low
- Quality control needed

**Comparison of reprogramming types**:

| Feature | Germline | Zygotic | iPSC |
|---------|----------|---------|------|
| **Trigger** | Developmental program | Fertilization | Yamanaka factors |
| **Speed** | Weeks | Days | Weeks |
| **Completeness** | Very high | Very high | Variable |
| **Methylation change** | Extensive | Extensive | Moderate |
| **Histone changes** | Extensive | Extensive | Moderate |
| **Efficiency** | 100% | 100% | <1% |
| **Natural** | Yes | Yes | No |

## Genomic Imprinting

### Parent-of-Origin Specific Gene Expression

**Genomic imprinting** = Genes expressed from only one parental allele

**Key concept**:
- Most genes: Both copies (maternal + paternal) expressed
- Imprinted genes: Only ONE copy expressed
- Which copy expressed depends on parent of origin
- Established by epigenetic marks (primarily DNA methylation)

**Statistics**:
- ~150 known imprinted genes in mice
- ~100 known imprinted genes in humans
- Often found in clusters
- Evolutionarily conserved in mammals
- Rare in other organisms (except some plants, insects)

### Mechanism of Imprinting

**Imprinting Control Regions (ICRs)**:

**What they are**:
- Regulatory DNA sequences
- Control imprinted gene clusters
- Differentially methylated between parents
- Act as master switches

**How they work**:

**During gametogenesis**:
```
Germline reprogramming
    ↓
Erasure of imprints
    ↓
Sex-specific de novo methylation
    ↓
Maternal ICRs: methylated in egg OR
Paternal ICRs: methylated in sperm
    ↓
Imprint established
```

**After fertilization**:
```
Embryo has:
- Maternal chromosome (ICR pattern from egg)
- Paternal chromosome (ICR pattern from sperm)
    ↓
ICR methylation maintained through development
    ↓
Differential expression based on parent of origin
```

**Two main mechanisms**:

**1. Enhancer competition model**:
```
Maternal chromosome (ICR unmethylated):
CTCF binds ICR → Blocks enhancer → Gene A silenced
                → Allows enhancer → Gene B expressed

Paternal chromosome (ICR methylated):
CTCF can't bind → Enhancer accesses Gene A → Gene A expressed
                → Gene B silenced
```

**2. ncRNA-mediated silencing**:
```
Maternal chromosome (ICR unmethylated):
lncRNA transcribed from ICR
    ↓
lncRNA spreads in cis
    ↓
Recruits repressive complexes
    ↓
Neighboring genes silenced
```

### Examples of Imprinted Genes

**IGF2 (Insulin-like Growth Factor 2)**:

**Expression**: Paternally expressed (maternal copy silenced)

**Function**: Promotes fetal growth

**Mechanism**:
- H19/IGF2 locus on chromosome 11
- Shared enhancers
- ICR between H19 and IGF2

**Maternal allele**:
```
ICR unmethylated
    ↓
CTCF binds ICR
    ↓
Insulator blocks IGF2 enhancer access
    ↓
IGF2 silenced, H19 expressed
```

**Paternal allele**:
```
ICR methylated
    ↓
CTCF cannot bind
    ↓
Enhancers access IGF2
    ↓
IGF2 expressed, H19 silenced
```

**Clinical significance**:
- Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome: Loss of imprinting → IGF2 overexpression
- Associated with childhood cancers
- Overgrowth, organomegaly

**H19**:

**Expression**: Maternally expressed (paternal copy silenced)

**Function**: 
- lncRNA (doesn't code for protein)
- Tumor suppressor properties
- Processed into miR-675
- Growth regulator

**Relationship to IGF2**:
- Reciprocally imprinted with IGF2
- Share regulatory elements
- Opposite expression patterns

**UBE3A (Ubiquitin Protein Ligase E3A)**:

**Expression**: **Brain-specific** maternal expression

**Unique feature**:
- In most tissues: Biallelic (both copies expressed)
- In neurons: Monoallelic (maternal only)
- Paternal silencing by SNHG14 antisense lncRNA

**Function**:
- E3 ubiquitin ligase
- Targets proteins for degradation
- Important for synaptic function

**Clinical significance**:

**Angelman Syndrome** (maternal loss):
- Deletion of maternal 15q11-13
- OR maternal UBE3A mutation
- OR paternal uniparental disomy (both chr 15 from father)
- Symptoms:
  - Severe intellectual disability
  - Speech impairment
  - Happy demeanor, frequent laughter
  - Ataxia, seizures

**Prader-Willi Syndrome** (paternal loss):
- Deletion of paternal 15q11-13
- OR paternal mutations
- OR maternal uniparental disomy
- Different genes affected (SNRPN and others)
- Symptoms:
  - Intellectual disability (milder)
  - Hyperphagia (excessive eating)
  - Obesity
  - Hypogonadism
  - Short stature

**Same region, opposite syndromes!**

**SNRPN/SNURF**:

**Expression**: Paternally expressed

**Function**: 
- SNRPN: Splicing factor
- Also produces SNHG14 lncRNA
- SNHG14 silences paternal UBE3A in neurons

**Clinical relevance**: Prader-Willi Syndrome

### Evolutionary Theories of Imprinting

**Parental Conflict Hypothesis** (David Haig):

**Theory**: 
- Maternal and paternal genes have conflicting interests
- Related to resource allocation

**Paternal genes**:
- Favor increased resource extraction from mother
- Promote fetal growth
- Tend to be growth-promoting when expressed

**Maternal genes**:
- Must balance resources among all offspring
- Limit any single fetus's demands
- Tend to be growth-limiting when expressed

**Examples**:
- IGF2 (paternal): Growth promoter
- IGF2R (maternal): Degrades IGF2
- Opposing effects on fetal growth

**Evidence**:
- Paternally expressed genes often promote growth
- Maternally expressed genes often restrict growth
- Important in placental mammals

### Imprinting Disorders

| Disorder | Genetic Cause | Chromosome | Key Features |
|----------|---------------|------------|--------------|
| **Prader-Willi** | Loss of paternal 15q11-13 | 15 | Hyperphagia, obesity, ID |
| **Angelman** | Loss of maternal UBE3A | 15 | Severe ID, happy demeanor |
| **Beckwith-Wiedemann** | Loss of maternal 11p15 | 11 | Overgrowth, cancer risk |
| **Silver-Russell** | Loss of paternal 11p15 | 11 | Growth restriction |
| **Transient neonatal diabetes** | Loss of maternal 6q24 | 6 | Temporary diabetes |

## X-Chromosome Inactivation (XCI)

### Dosage Compensation in Mammals

**The problem**:
- Females: XX (two X chromosomes)
- Males: XY (one X chromosome)
- X chromosome has ~1000 genes
- Without compensation: Females would have 2X gene expression

**The solution**: X-Chromosome Inactivation (XCI)

- Inactivate one X chromosome in each female cell
- Occurs early in development
- Random choice of which X to silence
- Maintains choice through all cell divisions
- Creates mosaic pattern in females

### The XIST/TSIX Regulatory System

**XIST** (X-Inactive Specific Transcript):

**Type**: Long non-coding RNA (~17 kb in humans)

**Function**: Master regulator of XCI

**Mechanism**:

1. **Counting phase**:
   - Cells "count" how many X chromosomes present
   - Prepare for XCI if more than one X

2. **Choice phase**:
   - ONE X chosen to remain active
   - OTHER X(s) will be inactivated
   - Random in most cells
   - Some cells show skewing

3. **Initiation**:
   - XIST transcribed from Xi (inactive X)
   - Accumulates in cis (on same chromosome)
   - Coats the entire X chromosome
   - Visible as "cloud" in nucleus

4. **Spreading**:
   - XIST spreads along chromosome
   - ~150 copies of XIST coat Xi
   - Recruits silencing complexes

5. **Maintenance**:
   - DNA methylation locks in silence
   - Histone modifications
   - Late replication
   - Nuclear periphery localization

**Protein partners of XIST**:

- **PRC2 complex** → Deposits H3K27me3
- **PRC1 complex** → Adds H2AK119ub1
- **SMCHD1** → DNA methylation, chromatin compaction
- **HDACs** → Histone deacetylation
- **MacroH2A** → Histone variant enrichment

**TSIX** (XIST antisense):

**Type**: lncRNA antisense to XIST

**Function**: Represses XIST

**Mechanism**:
- Transcribed from Xa (active X)
- Antisense orientation to XIST
- Blocks XIST expression
- Ensures only one X makes XIST

**Regulatory loop**:
```
Before XCI:
Both X chromosomes: TSIX expressed, XIST repressed

XCI initiation:
Future Xi: TSIX silenced, XIST activated
Future Xa: TSIX maintained, XIST repressed

Result:
Xi: No TSIX, high XIST → Inactivation
Xa: High TSIX, no XIST → Remains active
```

### Stages of XCI

**1. Initiation (Early embryo, day 5-6)**:

- Counting and choice
- XIST upregulation on Xi
- Chromosome-wide transcriptional silencing begins

**2. Spreading (Day 6-7)**:

- XIST coating entire chromosome
- Histone modifications accumulate:
  - H3K27me3 enrichment
  - H3K9me3 at some regions
  - Loss of H3K4me2/me3
  - Histone deacetylation
  - MacroH2A incorporation

**3. Establishment (Day 7-8)**:

- Transcriptional silencing complete
- CpG island methylation begins
- Most genes silenced
- Some "escape" genes remain active

**4. Maintenance (Throughout life)**:

- DNA methylation locks in silence
- XIST may be dispensable
- Chromatin state maintained
- Late replication
- Xi visible as Barr body

**Chromatin features of Xi**:

| Feature | Active X (Xa) | Inactive X (Xi) |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| **XIST coating** | No | Yes |
| **H3K27me3** | Low | High |
| **H3K9me3** | Low | Moderate |
| **H4 acetylation** | High | Low |
| **DNA methylation** | Low | High |
| **MacroH2A** | Normal | Enriched |
| **Replication** | Early S | Late S |
| **Location** | Nuclear interior | Periphery |
| **Structure** | Euchromatic | Heterochromatic |

### Random vs Imprinted X Inactivation

**Imprinted XCI** (Extraembryonic tissues):

- Occurs very early (4-cell stage)
- **Always** silences paternal X
- Non-random
- In placenta and yolk sac
- Evolutionary significance debated

**Random XCI** (Embryo proper):

- Occurs at blastocyst stage
- **Random** choice of which X
- ~50:50 ratio (but can skew)
- In all somatic cells
- Creates mosaic

**Skewed XCI**:

When inactivation isn't 50:50:

**Causes**:
- Random chance (especially with few cells)
- Selection advantage/disadvantage
- X-linked mutations favoring one X
- Age (skewing increases with age)

**Consequences**:
- Variable disease severity in carriers
- Some females with X-linked diseases symptomatic
- Example: Some female DMD carriers have muscle weakness

### Escape from XCI

**Not all genes are silenced**:

- ~15% of X-linked genes "escape" XCI in humans
- Expressed from both X chromosomes
- Variable between individuals
- May contribute to sex differences

**Examples of escape genes**:
- XIST itself
- KDM6A (H3K27me3 demethylase)
- KDM5C (H3K4 demethylase)
- SHOX (short stature gene)
- Many pseudoautosomal region genes

### Clinical Significance of XCI

**1. X-linked disease carriers**:
- Usually protected by having one normal X
- Severity depends on XCI pattern
- Skewed XCI can lead to symptoms

**2. Turner Syndrome (45,X)**:
- Only one X chromosome
- No XCI needed
- But escape genes affected
- Short stature, ovarian dysgenesis

**3. Klinefelter Syndrome (47,XXY)**:
- One X inactivated (like normal females)
- But still have phenotypic effects
- Possibly due to escape genes

**4. Female mosaicism**:
- Every female is mosaic for X-linked genes
- Can see this in:
  - Anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (patchy sweating)
  - Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency
  - Some calico cats!

**5. Cancer**:
- XCI maintenance lost in some cancers
- Xi can reactivate
- XIST deletions in some tumors

## Epigenetics in Development and Differentiation

### Lineage Commitment

**Developmental progression**:

```
Zygote (Totipotent)
    ↓
Blastocyst
    ↓ Lineage decisions
├─ Inner Cell Mass (Pluripotent) → Embryo
│   └─ Epiblast → Three germ layers
│       ├─ Ectoderm → Nervous system, skin
│       ├─ Mesoderm → Muscle, blood, bone
│       └─ Endoderm → Gut, lungs, liver
└─ Trophectoderm → Placenta
```

**Epigenetic changes during differentiation**:

**1. Progressive restriction of potency**:

**Pluripotent stem cells**:
- Open chromatin
- Bivalent promoters (H3K4me3 + H3K27me3)
- Low DNA methylation at regulatory elements
- High plasticity

**Multipotent progenitors**:
- Some lineage genes silenced (H3K27me3)
- Other lineage genes activated (H3K4me3)
- Increased DNA methylation at silenced loci
- Reduced plasticity

**Differentiated cells**:
- Extensive DNA methylation
- Clear H3K4me3 or H3K27me3 (not both)
- Stable chromatin states
- Committed identity

**2. Bivalent domains in ES cells**:

**What they are**:
- Promoters with BOTH H3K4me3 AND H3K27me3
- "Poised" for activation or silencing
- Found at developmental transcription factors
- Unique to stem cells

**Function**:
- Keep genes repressed but ready
- Maintained by PRC2 (H3K27me3) and MLL (H3K4me3)
- Allow rapid activation when needed
- Resolution during differentiation

**Resolution during differentiation**:
```
ES cell: Gene X has H3K4me3 + H3K27me3 (bivalent)
                    ↓
            Differentiation signal
                    ↓
        ┌───────────┴───────────┐
    Cell A                  Cell B
H3K4me3 only            H3K27me3 only
Gene ON                 Gene OFF
```

**3. Pioneer factors**:

**Definition**: Transcription factors that:
- Bind to closed chromatin
- Can access nucleosomal DNA
- Initiate opening of chromatin
- Recruit other factors

**Examples**:
- **FoxA**: Liver development
- **GATA**: Blood cell development
- **PU.1**: Macrophage differentiation
- **Oct4, Sox2, Nanog**: Pluripotency
- **MyoD**: Muscle differentiation

**Mechanism**:
```
Closed chromatin
    ↓
Pioneer factor binds
    ↓
Recruits chromatin remodelers
    ↓
Recruits HATs
    ↓
Open chromatin
    ↓
Other TFs can bind
    ↓
Gene activation
    ↓
Lineage commitment
```

### Tissue-Specific Gene Expression

**How cells maintain identity**:

**DNA methylation patterns**:
- Liver-specific genes: Unmethylated in liver, methylated in brain
- Neuron-specific genes: Unmethylated in neurons, methylated in liver
- Maintained through divisions
- Stable and heritable

**Enhancer landscapes**:
- Different cell types activate different enhancers
- Marked by H3K27ac in active tissues
- Cell-type-specific transcription factors
- Super-enhancers at identity genes

**Example - Blood cell differentiation**:

```
Hematopoietic Stem Cell
        ↓
    ┌───┴───┐
Myeloid    Lymphoid
    ↓          ↓
  ┌─┴─┐      ┌─┴─┐
Granulocyte Monocyte  B cell  T cell
```

**Epigenetic changes**:
- PU.1 high: Macrophage fate
- GATA1 high: Erythrocyte fate
- Antagonistic interactions
- Mutual exclusion by chromatin changes
- Progressive methylation of alternate fates

### Stem Cell Plasticity

**Types of stem cells**:

**1. Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs)**:
- Pluripotent
- Can become any cell type
- Bivalent chromatin domains
- Open chromatin overall
- Low DNA methylation

**2. Adult Stem Cells**:
- Multipotent (limited fates)
- Tissue-specific (hematopoietic, neural, etc.)
- More restricted chromatin
- Higher DNA methylation
- Tissue-specific enhancers active

**3. Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs)**:
- Reprogrammed somatic cells
- Similar to ESCs (but not identical)
- Some epigenetic memory retained
- Variable quality

**Maintenance of stemness**:

**Pluripotency network**:
- Oct4, Sox2, Nanog transcription factors
- Auto-regulatory loops
- Repress differentiation genes
- Maintain open chromatin

**Epigenetic requirements**:
- Active DNA demethylation (TET1/2)
- Polycomb silencing of differentiation genes
- Open chromatin (chromatin remodelers)
- Specific histone marks

**Niche signals**:
- LIF/STAT3 (mouse ES cells)
- FGF/ERK and TGFβ (human ES cells)
- Maintain pluripotency network
- Prevent spontaneous differentiation

## Environmental Epigenetics

### Nutrition, Toxins, and Stress Effects

Epigenetics is the molecular bridge between environment and gene expression!

### Nutritional Effects

**Methyl donors and one-carbon metabolism**:

**Key nutrients**:
- Folate (Vitamin B9)
- Vitamin B12
- Choline
- Methionine
- Betaine

**Biochemical pathway**:
```
Dietary methyl donors
    ↓
S-Adenosyl Methionine (SAM)
    ↓ (methyl donor for DNMTs)
DNA methylation
    ↓
S-Adenosyl Homocysteine (SAH)
```

**Effects of deficiency**:
- Reduced SAM availability
- Global hypomethylation
- CpG island hypermethylation (paradoxically)
- Neural tube defects
- Cancer risk increased

**Agouti Mouse Experiment** (Classic example):

**Background**:
- Avy allele: Agouti gene with retrotransposon
- Methylation of retrotransposon → normal brown coat
- Unmethylated → yellow coat, obesity, diabetes

**Experiment**:
- Pregnant mice fed methyl-donor-rich diet
- OR control diet

**Results**:
- Supplemented diet → More brown offspring
- Control diet → More yellow offspring
- **Same genes, different epigenetic marks!**
- **Diet changed epigenetics, changed phenotype**

**Implications**:
- Maternal nutrition affects offspring epigenome
- Effects can persist into adulthood
- Demonstrates environmental epigenetic effects

**Genistein (soy compound)**:
- Also shifts Agouti phenotype
- DNMT inhibitor
- Shows dietary compounds can affect epigenome

### Toxic Exposures

**Endocrine disruptors**:

**Bisphenol A (BPA)**:
- Plastic component
- Estrogen mimic
- Effects:
  - Alters DNA methylation patterns
  - Affects developmental genes
  - Transgenerational effects in rodents
  - Linked to obesity, reproductive issues

**Diethylstilbestrol (DES)**:
- Synthetic estrogen (used 1940s-1970s)
- Given to pregnant women
- Epigenetic effects:
  - Altered methylation in offspring
  - Increased cancer risk (daughters)
  - Effects in grandchildren too
  - Classic transgenerational example

**Heavy metals**:

**Arsenic**:
- Interferes with SAM metabolism
- Alters DNA methylation globally
- Histone modification changes
- Cancer risk

**Lead**:
- Changes DNA methylation
- Affects neurodevelopment
- Persistent effects

**Cadmium**:
- Mimics zinc, interferes with enzymes
- Epigenetic dysregulation
- Found in cigarette smoke

**Air pollution**:
- Particulate matter exposure
- Changes DNA methylation
- Effects on cardiovascular genes
- Respiratory disease risk

### Stress Effects

**Psychological stress**:

**Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis**:
- Stress → Cortisol release
- Affects gene expression
- Can cause epigenetic changes
- Long-lasting effects

**Early life stress**:

**Maternal care in rats** (Michael Meaney's work):

**High maternal care**:
- Increased licking/grooming
- Offspring: Less stressed as adults
- Glucocorticoid receptor gene LESS methylated
- Higher receptor expression
- Better stress response

**Low maternal care**:
- Less licking/grooming
- Offspring: More stressed as adults
- Glucocorticoid receptor gene MORE methylated
- Lower receptor expression
- Poor stress response

**Reversibility**:
- Cross-fostering reverses effect
- HDAC inhibitors reverse methylation
- Shows epigenetic, not genetic

**Human studies**:

**Childhood adversity**:
- Abuse, neglect alter epigenome
- Changes in stress response genes
- Increased psychiatric disorder risk
- Changes detectable in blood cells

**PTSD** (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder):
- Altered methylation patterns
- Especially in stress-related genes
- May predispose or result from PTSD
- Potential biomarkers

### Transgenerational Epigenetic Inheritance

**Definitions**:

**Intergenerational** (F1, F2):
- Direct exposure occurred
- F0: Pregnant mother exposed
- F1: Developing fetus exposed
- F2: Developing germ cells in F1 exposed
- Not "true" transgenerational

**Transgenerational** (F3+):
- No direct exposure
- Effects in F3 generation
- True epigenetic inheritance
- Controversial in mammals

**Evidence in different organisms**:

**Plants**:
- Well-documented
- Stress-induced changes persist
- Paramutation phenomena
- RNA-based inheritance

**C. elegans**:
- Strong evidence
- RNAi effects last generations
- piRNA-based inheritance
- Can last >100 generations

**Mammals**:
- Limited clear examples
- Most marks erased in germline
- Some evidence for:
  - Metabolic effects
  - Stress responses
  - Toxin exposure effects
- Mechanisms unclear

**Dutch Hunger Winter (1944-1945)**:

**Background**:
- Severe famine in Netherlands
- Well-documented population
- Pregnant women exposed

**Findings in offspring (F1)**:
- Exposed in early pregnancy: Increased obesity, cardiovascular disease
- Exposed in late pregnancy: Glucose intolerance
- DNA methylation changes detected decades later
- Specific genes affected (IGF2, others)

**F2 generation**:
- Some effects in grandchildren
- Lower birth weights
- Increased disease risk
- Debated if true transgenerational (F1 gametes exposed)

**Överkalix Study (Sweden)**:

**Design**:
- Historical records of food availability
- Multi-generational health data

**Findings**:
- Paternal grandfather's food abundance
- Affected grandson's longevity
- Sex-specific effects
- Suggested epigenetic inheritance

**Interpretation**:
- Controversial
- Confounding factors possible
- Mechanism unknown
- Needs replication

### Epigenetic Epidemiology

**Epigenome-Wide Association Studies (EWAS)**:

**Similar to GWAS, but**:
- Measure DNA methylation (usually)
- Associate with disease/trait
- Identify epigenetic risk factors

**Challenges**:
- Tissue specificity (blood vs target tissue)
- Causation vs correlation
- Environmental confounders
- Temporal dynamics

**Successes**:
- Smoking: Robust methylation signatures
- Aging: Epigenetic clock markers
- Some diseases: Consistent findings

**Biobanks**:
- Large-scale epigenetic profiling
- UK Biobank, others
- Longitudinal data
- Gene-environment interactions

## Epigenetic Crosstalk

### Interaction Between DNA Methylation, Histone Marks, and ncRNAs

Epigenetic mechanisms don't work in isolation—they communicate and reinforce each other.

### DNA Methylation ↔ Histone Modifications

**1. DNA methylation recruits histone modifiers**:

**MBD proteins** (Methyl-CpG Binding Domain):
- Bind methylated DNA
- Recruit HDACs
- Remove activating histone marks
- Example: MeCP2, MBD1-4

**Pathway**:
```
DNA methylation
    ↓
MBD proteins bind
    ↓
Recruit NuRD complex (HDAC + chromatin remodeler)
    ↓
Histone deacetylation
    ↓
Chromatin compaction
    ↓
Gene silencing reinforced
```

**2. Histone modifications guide DNA methylation**:

**H3K9me3 → DNA methylation**:
- DNMT3A/B recognize H3K9me3
- UHRF1 binds H3K9me3
- Recruits DNMT1
- Establishes/maintains DNA methylation

**H3K4me3 → Prevents DNA methylation**:
- DNMT3A/L inhibited by H3K4me3
- Protects CpG islands
- Keeps promoters unmethylated

**H3K36me3 → Gene body methylation**:
- DNMT3B recruited to H3K36me3
- Explains high methylation in gene bodies
- Different from promoter methylation

**Feedback loops**:
```
Scenario 1 - Silencing:
DNA methylation → MBD → HDAC → H3K9 deacetylation
       ↑                              ↓
       ←─────── SUV39H ←──── H3K9me3 ←┘
       
Self-reinforcing silencing

Scenario 2 - Activation:
Unmethylated DNA → TET enzymes → 5hmC
       ↑                              ↓
       ←─────── Active marks ←──── Open chromatin
       
Self-reinforcing activation
```

### Histone Modifications ↔ ncRNAs

**1. ncRNAs recruit histone modifiers**:

**lncRNAs as guides**:
- HOTAIR recruits PRC2 (H3K27me3) and LSD1 (removes H3K4me)
- XIST recruits PRC2 and PRC1
- AIR recruits G9a (H3K9me2)
- Provides specificity to enzyme complexes

**2. Histone marks affect ncRNA expression**:

**miRNA genes**:
- Can be silenced by DNA methylation
- Regulated by histone modifications
- Example: miR-34 regulated by p53 and epigenetics

**lncRNA loci**:
- Often have bivalent marks in ES cells
- Developmentally regulated
- Epigenetic control of their expression

### DNA Methylation ↔ ncRNAs

**1. ncRNAs direct DNA methylation** (in some organisms):

**In plants** (RdDM pathway):
- siRNAs guide DNA methylation
- Target complementary sequences
- Direct de novo methylation

**In mammals** (limited):
- piRNAs in germline
- May guide DNA methylation to transposons
- Mechanism less clear than plants

**2. DNA methylation affects ncRNA expression**:

**miRNA silencing**:
- miRNA gene promoters can be methylated
- Turns off tumor suppressor miRNAs
- Cancer mechanism

**lncRNA regulation**:
- Many lncRNA loci controlled by methylation
- Tissue-specific patterns

### Three-Way Interactions

**Polycomb silencing**:

```
lncRNA (e.g., XIST)
    ↓
Recruits PRC2
    ↓
H3K27me3 deposited
    ↓
Recruits PRC1
    ↓
H2AK119ub1 added
    ↓
Recruits DNMTs
    ↓
DNA methylation
    ↓
Stable, maintained silencing
```

**All three mechanisms collaborate!**

**Activating network**:

```
TF binding
    ↓
Recruits TET enzymes (DNA demethylation)
    ↓
Recruits HATs (histone acetylation)
    ↓
Chromatin remodeling
    ↓
H3K4me3 deposition
    ↓
Blocks DNA methylation
    ↓
Transcription (including eRNAs, miRNAs)
    ↓
Positive feedback
```

### Crosstalk in Different Contexts

**Development**:
- Coordinated changes in all marks
- Sequential recruitment
- Stable cell identity

**Cancer**:
- Dysregulation of crosstalk
- Hypermethylation + loss of H3K4me3
- Abnormal ncRNA expression
- Vicious cycles

**Aging**:
- Loss of coordination
- Stochastic changes
- "Epigenetic drift"
- Accumulated errors

### Therapeutic Implications

**Combination therapies**:
- DNMT inhibitors + HDAC inhibitors
- Synergistic effects
- FDA-approved combinations
- Target multiple mechanisms

**Understanding crosstalk helps**:
- Predict drug effects
- Design better therapies
- Avoid resistance mechanisms
- Target feedback loops

## Epigenetic Mechanisms in Disease

- **Main mechanisms**:

  - **DNA methylation**: Adding CH₃ to cytosines (usually silences genes)

  - **Histone modifications**: Chemical tags on histones (activate or repress genes)

  - **Chromatin remodeling**: Moving nucleosomes (changes accessibility)

  - **Non-coding RNAs**: Guide epigenetic changes

- **CpG islands**: Regions with many CpG sites, usually unmethylated

- **Histone code**: Different modification combinations mean different things

- **Epigenomics**: Genome-wide study of epigenetic marks

- **Prokaryotes**: Limited epigenetics (mainly DNA methylation)

- **Eukaryotes**: Complex, multilayered epigenetic regulation

- **Environment affects epigenetics**: Diet, stress, toxins, lifestyle

- **Epigenetic inheritance**: Marks can be passed through cell divisions and sometimes across generations

- **Disease connection**: Cancer, developmental disorders, aging, neurological diseases

- **Therapies**: Epigenetic drugs can reverse some changes
