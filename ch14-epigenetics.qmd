# Epigenetics and Epigenomics

## Chapter Overview

This chapter explores the fascinating world of epigenetics—the study of heritable changes in gene function that occur without alterations to the DNA sequence itself. We'll discover how cells with identical DNA can have vastly different functions, how environmental factors can influence gene expression across generations, and how epigenetic dysregulation contributes to disease. From DNA methylation to histone modifications, from chromatin remodeling to non-coding RNAs, we'll examine the molecular mechanisms that allow organisms to adapt, develop, and respond to their environment.

## Definition and Overview of Epigenetics

### What Is Epigenetics?

**Epigenetics** studies changes in gene activity that DON'T change the DNA sequence itself.

**The word "epigenetic" means**:

- **Epi** = above or on top of

- **Genetic** = relating to genes

- So: "Above genetics" or "On top of genes"

Think of it like:

- DNA = the words in a book

- Epigenetics = highlighting, bookmarks, and notes that change how you read the book

- Same words, but different reading experience!

**More formally**, epigenetics refers to:

- Heritable changes in gene expression or cellular phenotype
- Changes that do not involve alterations to the underlying DNA sequence
- Modifications that can be maintained through cell divisions
- Reversible changes that respond to developmental and environmental cues

**Historical context**:

The term "epigenetics" was coined by Conrad Waddington in 1942 to describe "the interactions of genes with their environment that bring the phenotype into being." Today, it encompasses all molecular mechanisms that regulate gene expression beyond the DNA sequence.

## Difference between Genetics and Epigenetics

Understanding the distinction between genetics and epigenetics is crucial:

### Genetics

**What it is**:

- The study of genes and DNA sequences
- Focuses on the genetic code itself (A, T, G, C)
- Deals with heredity through DNA

**Key characteristics**:

- Changes are typically **permanent** (mutations)
- Follows Mendelian inheritance patterns
- Sequence-based: altering the actual letters of genetic code
- Relatively **stable** throughout life
- Passed from parent to offspring through DNA replication

**Example**: A mutation in the BRCA1 gene sequence increases breast cancer risk—this change is permanent and inherited.

### Epigenetics

**What it is**:

- The study of changes in gene **activity** without changing DNA sequence
- Focuses on chemical modifications to DNA and histones
- Deals with gene expression regulation

**Key characteristics**:

- Changes are potentially **reversible**
- Can be influenced by environment, age, lifestyle, disease
- Modification-based: adding or removing chemical groups
- **Dynamic** and responsive to signals
- Can be passed through cell divisions, sometimes across generations

**Example**: Identical twins have the same DNA, but different epigenetic marks lead to different disease susceptibility—these differences accumulate over time.

### Key Comparisons

| Feature | Genetics | Epigenetics |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **What changes?** | DNA sequence | Gene expression |
| **Permanence** | Usually permanent | Reversible |
| **Inheritance** | Always inherited | Sometimes inherited |
| **Environmental influence** | Minimal | Significant |
| **Therapeutic potential** | Hard to change | Can be targeted by drugs |
| **Stability** | Very stable | Dynamic |

Think of it this way:

- **Genetics** = The hardware (fixed components)
- **Epigenetics** = The software (changeable settings)

## Epigenetic Inheritance and Reversibility

### The Dynamic Nature of Epigenetic Marks

One of the most remarkable features of epigenetic modifications is their **reversibility**, which distinguishes them from genetic mutations.

**Key properties**:

1. **Mitotic inheritance** (cell division):
   - Epigenetic marks are copied when cells divide
   - This allows daughter cells to maintain the same identity as parent cells
   - How liver cells stay liver cells through many divisions
   - Involves maintenance mechanisms that "remember" marks

2. **Meiotic inheritance** (across generations):
   - Most epigenetic marks are **erased** during reproduction
   - Prevents inheritance of temporary environmental responses
   - Ensures each generation starts relatively fresh
   - Some marks escape erasure—this is transgenerational inheritance

3. **Reversibility**:
   - Unlike DNA mutations, epigenetic changes can be reversed
   - Environmental factors can add or remove marks
   - Therapeutic interventions can modify epigenetic states
   - This makes epigenetic changes both a risk and an opportunity

### Types of Epigenetic Inheritance

**Intergenerational inheritance**:

- Direct exposure affects the organism and its developing gametes
- Example: Pregnant woman exposed to famine affects her child (F1) and the child's developing eggs/sperm (F2)
- Not "true" transgenerational—direct exposure occurred

**Transgenerational inheritance**:

- Effects persist beyond F2 generation (F3 and beyond)
- No direct exposure to the original environmental factor
- More controversial in mammals
- Well-documented in plants, worms (C. elegans), and some other organisms

**Evidence in different organisms**:

- **Plants**: Strong evidence for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance
- **C. elegans**: RNA-mediated inheritance can last many generations
- **Mammals**: Most marks erased; rare examples of transgenerational effects
- **Humans**: Limited but growing evidence

**Reprogramming events**:

Two major "epigenetic reset" events occur in mammals:

1. **Zygotic reprogramming**: Just after fertilization
2. **Germline reprogramming**: During germ cell (egg/sperm) development

These erasure events explain why most acquired characteristics are NOT inherited!

### Why Epigenetics Matters

**The Big Question**: If all your cells have the same DNA, why are they different?

- Brain cells and muscle cells have identical DNA

- But they look and act completely different!

- **Answer**: Epigenetics!

Epigenetic marks determine:

- Which genes are turned ON in each cell type

- Which genes are turned OFF

- How cells remember their identity

- How cells respond to the environment

- How development proceeds in an orderly fashion

- How organisms adapt to environmental changes

- How experiences can affect gene expression

- How diseases develop and might be treated

## DNA Methylation

### Adding Chemical Tags to DNA

**DNA methylation** = Adding a methyl group (CH₃) to DNA

**Where it happens**:

- Usually on cytosine (C) bases

- Specifically in "CpG" sequences (C next to G)

- "p" stands for the phosphate between them

**What it looks like**:

- Normal: Cytosine (C)

- Methylated: 5-methylcytosine (5mC)

- Same base, just with a tiny chemical decoration

Think of it like:

- Putting a sticker on a letter

- The letter is still there and readable

- But the sticker changes how it's treated

### CpG Islands and Their Importance

**CpG islands** = Regions with lots of CpG sequences

**Key facts**:

- "CpG" refers to cytosine-phosphate-guanine dinucleotides
- Found near **60-70% of human gene promoters**
- Typically **500-2000 base pairs long**
- High GC content (>50%)
- Usually UN-methylated in normal cells (genes are ready to be expressed)
- If they GET methylated → gene is turned off

**Why "islands"?**

- CpG dinucleotides are relatively rare in most of the genome (~1%)
- They're "depleted" because methylated CpGs mutate over evolutionary time (5mC → T)
- CpG islands are protected regions where CpGs are preserved
- These islands are like oases in a CpG-poor desert

**Location and function**:

- **Promoter CpG islands**: Control gene transcription start sites
- **Intragenic islands**: Found within gene bodies
- **Intergenic islands**: Between genes, may regulate distant genes
- **Shore regions**: Areas flanking CpG islands (up to 2kb away)—often show tissue-specific methylation patterns

**Examples**:

- **Cancer**: Tumor suppressor genes get abnormally methylated → cancer
- **Development**: Methylation patterns change as embryo develops
- **X-inactivation**: Methylation silences one X chromosome in females
- **Aging**: CpG islands gradually lose protection and become methylated

### DNA Methyltransferases (DNMTs)

The enzymes that add methyl groups to DNA are called **DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs)**.

**DNMT1 - The "Maintenance" Methyltransferase**:

- **Function**: Copies methylation patterns during DNA replication
- **How it works**: Recognizes hemi-methylated DNA (one strand methylated)
- **Role**: Maintains existing patterns through cell divisions
- **Specificity**: Prefers hemi-methylated substrates
- **Location**: Associates with replication fork
- **Importance**: Ensures daughter cells inherit same methylation pattern as parent

Think of DNMT1 as a photocopier—it copies existing marks onto new DNA strands!

**DNMT3A and DNMT3B - The "De Novo" Methyltransferases**:

- **Function**: Establish NEW methylation patterns
- **When active**: During development, germ cell formation
- **DNMT3A**: 
  - Active in most tissues
  - Important for somatic cell methylation
  - Mutations cause growth disorders
- **DNMT3B**: 
  - Particularly active in early development
  - Critical for embryonic development
  - Mutations cause ICF syndrome (Immunodeficiency, Centromeric instability, Facial anomalies)
- **Collaboration**: Often work together with DNMT1

Think of DNMT3A/B as architects—they design new methylation patterns from scratch!

**DNMT3L - The Helper**:

- Does NOT have methyltransferase activity itself
- Stimulates DNMT3A and DNMT3B activity
- Critical for establishing maternal imprints
- Mutations cause infertility

**Coordination of DNMTs**:

```
DNA Replication:
Parent DNA: [methylated-C]==========[methylated-C]
               ↓                         ↓
           DNA copied
               ↓
New DNA:    [methylated-C]==========C
            C===========[methylated-C]
               ↓
           DNMT1 acts
               ↓
Daughter:   [methylated-C]===========[methylated-C]
            [methylated-C]===========[methylated-C]
```

### Demethylation and TET Enzymes

For a long time, scientists thought DNA methylation was essentially permanent. Then the **TET enzymes** were discovered!

**TET Enzymes (Ten-Eleven Translocation enzymes)**:

- **TET1, TET2, TET3** - Three family members in mammals
- **Function**: Convert 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC)
- **Result**: First step in active demethylation pathway

**The Demethylation Pathway**:

1. **5mC** (5-methylcytosine)
   ↓ TET enzymes
2. **5hmC** (5-hydroxymethylcytosine)
   ↓ TET enzymes
3. **5fC** (5-formylcytosine)
   ↓ TET enzymes
4. **5caC** (5-carboxylcytosine)
   ↓ TDG enzyme + BER pathway
5. **C** (unmodified cytosine)

**Properties of oxidized methylcytosines**:

- **5hmC**: Not just an intermediate—also has its own regulatory functions
- Enriched in brain tissue and embryonic stem cells
- Can recruit specific protein readers
- May represent a stable epigenetic mark

**Two types of demethylation**:

1. **Active demethylation**:
   - TET-mediated oxidation pathway
   - Can occur rapidly in response to signals
   - Important in development and cell differentiation
   - Critical for paternal genome demethylation in zygote

2. **Passive demethylation**:
   - Occurs when DNMT1 is blocked or absent
   - Methylation lost through DNA replication
   - Slower process
   - Important in some developmental contexts

**TET enzyme importance**:

- **Development**: Essential for zygotic and germline reprogramming
- **Cancer**: TET2 frequently mutated in blood cancers
- **Brain**: High TET1 expression; important for neuronal function
- **Reprogramming**: Critical for iPSC generation

### Effects of DNA Methylation on Gene Expression

**Promoter methylation** → **Gene Silencing**:

**How it works**:

1. **Physical blocking**:
   - Methyl groups prevent transcription factors from binding
   - Like putting a lock on a door

2. **Recruiting silencing complexes**:
   - Methylated DNA attracts methyl-binding domain (MBD) proteins
   - MBD proteins recruit histone deacetylases (HDACs)
   - HDACs remove activating marks from histones
   - Creates compact, inactive chromatin

3. **Creating heterochromatin**:
   - Methylated regions become densely packed
   - Transcription machinery cannot access DNA
   - Gene is stably silenced

**Gene body methylation** → **Variable effects**:

Surprisingly, methylation WITHIN gene bodies can:
- Correlate with **increased** transcription
- Prevent spurious transcription initiation
- Regulate alternative splicing
- Mark actively transcribed genes

**Context-dependent effects**:

| Location | Methylation Level | Effect |
|----------|------------------|---------|
| Promoter CpG islands | High | Strong silencing |
| Gene bodies | High | Often associated with expression |
| Enhancers | High | Reduced activity |
| Repetitive elements | High | Silencing (protective) |
| Imprinted genes | Parent-specific | Monoallelic expression |

### Genomic Imprinting

**Genomic imprinting** = Parent-of-origin-specific gene expression

**Key concept**:

- For most genes, both copies (maternal and paternal) are expressed
- For **imprinted genes**, only ONE copy is expressed
- Which copy is expressed depends on which parent it came from
- The other copy is silenced by DNA methylation

**How it works**:

1. During germ cell formation, specific genes get methylated
2. This methylation is maintained after fertilization
3. Methylated allele is silenced
4. Unmethylated allele is expressed
5. Pattern is reset each generation in the germline

**Why imprinting exists**:

- **Parental conflict hypothesis**: Mother and father have different evolutionary interests
- **Dosage regulation**: Some genes need precise expression levels
- **Brain development**: Many imprinted genes affect behavior and development

**Imprinting disorders**:

- **Prader-Willi syndrome**: Loss of paternal 15q11-13 expression
- **Angelman syndrome**: Loss of maternal 15q11-13 expression
- Same chromosomal region, different diseases depending on parent of origin!

We'll discuss specific examples in detail later in the "Genomic Imprinting" section.

### X-Chromosome Inactivation (XCI)

**The problem**:

- Females have TWO X chromosomes (XX)
- Males have ONE X chromosome (XY)
- How to balance X-linked gene expression?

**The solution**: X-Chromosome Inactivation (XCI)

- One X chromosome in each female cell is **randomly inactivated**
- Occurs early in development
- Inactivated X becomes a **Barr body** (condensed, silent chromatin)
- Same X remains inactive in all descendant cells

**Role of DNA methylation in XCI**:

1. **Initiation**: Guided by XIST lncRNA (more on this later)
2. **Spreading**: Silencing spreads along the chromosome
3. **Maintenance**: DNA methylation LOCKS in the silent state
4. **Stability**: Methylation ensures X remains inactive through divisions

**Methylation patterns**:

- CpG islands on inactive X become heavily methylated
- This stabilizes the inactive state
- Active X remains unmethylated
- Pattern is mitotically heritable

**Clinical significance**:

- X-linked diseases can have variable severity in females
- Depends on which X is inactivated in each cell
- Random inactivation creates mosaic pattern

We'll explore the molecular mechanisms in greater detail in the dedicated "X-Chromosome Inactivation" section.

## Histone Modifications

### Decorating the Histone Proteins

Remember histones? DNA wraps around them like thread on spools.

**Histone modifications** = Adding or removing chemical groups to histone proteins

**Where modifications occur**:

- Histone "tails" sticking out from nucleosomes

- Like ribbons on wrapped presents

- These tails are accessible to modifying enzymes

- Rich in lysine (K), arginine (R), serine (S), and threonine (T) residues

### Types of Histone Modifications

**1. Acetylation** (adding acetyl groups):

- **Effect**: Loosens chromatin, gene activation

- **Where**: Lysine amino acids

- **Think of it as**: Opening the curtains to let in light

**2. Methylation** (adding methyl groups):

- **Effect**: Can activate OR repress genes (depends on location!)

- **Where**: Lysine or arginine amino acids

- **Complex**: Different methylation patterns mean different things

**3. Phosphorylation** (adding phosphate groups):

- **Effect**: Various effects depending on location

- **Important for**: Cell division, DNA repair

**4. Ubiquitination** (adding ubiquitin protein):

- **Effect**: Can activate or repress genes

- **Also can**: Mark histones for degradation

### Histone Acetylation in Detail

**Histone Acetyltransferases (HATs)**:

**What they do**:
- Add acetyl groups (-COCH₃) to lysine residues
- **Neutralize positive charge** on histones
- Weaken histone-DNA interaction
- Open up chromatin structure
- Generally → **Gene activation**

**Major HAT families**:

1. **GNAT family** (Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferases):
   - Gcn5, PCAF
   - Often part of large complexes
   - Acetylate H3 and H4

2. **MYST family**:
   - MOZ, MOF, TIP60
   - Important in development
   - Some mutations cause cancer

3. **p300/CBP family**:
   - Broad substrate specificity
   - Act as transcriptional co-activators
   - Integrate multiple signaling pathways

**Histone Deacetylases (HDACs)**:

**What they do**:
- Remove acetyl groups from lysines
- Restore positive charge on histones
- Strengthen histone-DNA binding
- Condense chromatin
- Generally → **Gene repression**

**HDAC classes**:

1. **Class I HDACs** (HDAC1, 2, 3, 8):
   - Found mainly in nucleus
   - Related to yeast Rpd3
   - Broadly expressed

2. **Class II HDACs** (HDAC4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10):
   - Can shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm
   - Tissue-specific expression
   - Regulated by cellular signals

3. **Class III HDACs** (Sirtuins: SIRT1-7):
   - NAD⁺-dependent (different mechanism)
   - Involved in aging and metabolism
   - Connected to caloric restriction effects

4. **Class IV HDACs** (HDAC11):
   - Shares features of Class I and II
   - Least studied

**Balance is key**:

```
   HATs          HDACs
    ↓              ↓
Acetylation ←→ Deacetylation
    ↓              ↓
Open chromatin  Closed chromatin
    ↓              ↓
Active genes    Silent genes
```

**Clinical relevance**:
- HDAC inhibitors are approved cancer drugs
- Work by reactivating silenced tumor suppressor genes
- Examples: Vorinostat, Romidepsin

### Histone Methylation in Detail

**Histone Methyltransferases (HMTs)**:

**Complexity**:
- Can add 1, 2, or 3 methyl groups (mono-, di-, tri-methylation)
- Different degrees of methylation have different meanings
- Different lysines can be methylated (K4, K9, K27, K36, K79)

**Major HMTs**:

1. **SET domain-containing HMTs**:
   - Largest family
   - MLL, NSD, SET1/2, SUV39H, G9a, EZH2
   
2. **Non-SET domain HMTs**:
   - DOT1L (methylates H3K79)
   - Uses different mechanism

**Key methylation marks**:

**Activating marks**:
- **H3K4me3** (Histone 3, Lysine 4, tri-methylation):
  - Found at active promoters
  - Mark of active transcription
  - Added by MLL complexes
  
- **H3K36me3** (Histone 3, Lysine 36, tri-methylation):
  - Found in gene bodies
  - Mark of active transcription elongation
  - Prevents cryptic transcription

**Repressive marks**:
- **H3K9me3** (Histone 3, Lysine 9, tri-methylation):
  - Found in heterochromatin
  - Added by SUV39H enzymes
  - Creates binding sites for HP1 protein
  - Maintains gene silencing
  
- **H3K27me3** (Histone 3, Lysine 27, tri-methylation):
  - Added by PRC2 complex (contains EZH2)
  - Important for development
  - Silences developmental genes
  - Maintains cell identity

**H3K9 methylation pathway**:

```
Unmethylated H3K9
      ↓ G9a/GLP (euchromatic regions)
H3K9me1/me2
      ↓ SUV39H (heterochromatic regions)
H3K9me3
      ↓ Recruits HP1
Heterochromatin formation
      ↓
Gene silencing
```

**Histone Demethylases (KDMs)**:

Yes, histone methylation is reversible too!

**Two families**:

1. **LSD family** (Lysine-Specific Demethylases):
   - LSD1/KDM1A, LSD2/KDM1B
   - Remove mono- and di-methyl groups
   - FAD-dependent enzymes
   - Cannot remove tri-methyl groups

2. **JmjC domain-containing demethylases**:
   - Many family members (KDM2-KDM8)
   - Can remove all methylation states (me1, me2, me3)
   - Iron and α-ketoglutarate-dependent
   - More versatile than LSDs

**Example - LSD1**:
- Removes H3K4me1/me2 (activating marks) → repression
- Can also remove H3K9me1/me2 (repressive marks) → activation
- Context-dependent function
- Targeted by drugs for cancer treatment

### Other Important Histone Modifications

**Phosphorylation**:

**Key marks**:
- **H3S10ph** (Histone 3, Serine 10, phosphorylation):
  - Added during mitosis
  - Chromosome condensation
  - Also involved in gene activation
  
- **H2AXS139ph** (γH2AX):
  - Mark of DNA damage
  - Recruits DNA repair machinery
  - Spreads megabases from break site

**Function**:
- Rapid and reversible
- Kinases add phosphate groups
- Phosphatases remove them
- Often cross-talks with other modifications

**Ubiquitination**:

**H2AK119ub1** (H2A, Lysine 119, monoubiquitination):
- Added by PRC1 complex
- Gene repression
- Works with H3K27me3
- Part of Polycomb silencing system

**H2BK120ub1** (H2B, Lysine 120, monoubiquitination):
- Gene activation!
- Required for H3K4 and H3K79 methylation
- Trans-histone regulation
- Important for transcription elongation

**Sumoylation**:

- Addition of SUMO proteins (Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifiers)
- Generally associated with transcriptional repression
- Less well understood than other modifications
- Can compete with acetylation at same lysines

**ADP-ribosylation**:

- Addition of ADP-ribose groups
- Catalyzed by PARP enzymes
- Important for DNA damage response
- Can modify core histones and H1

### The Histone Code Hypothesis

**The "histone code" hypothesis**:

- Different combinations of modifications send different signals

- Like a complex language written on histones

- Specific proteins "read" these marks and respond accordingly

**The code concept**:

```
Histone tail:  [K4]---[K9]---[K14]---[K18]---[K27]
Modifications:  me3    ac     ac      ac      me3
Meaning:      "Bivalent promoter - poised for activation"

vs.

Histone tail:  [K4]---[K9]---[K14]---[K18]---[K27]
Modifications:  me1    me3    -       -       -
Meaning:      "Heterochromatin - permanently silenced"
```

**Reader proteins**:

Different protein domains recognize specific modifications:

1. **Bromodomains**:
   - Recognize acetylated lysines
   - Found in HATs, chromatin remodelers, transcription factors
   - Example: BRD4 reads H3K27ac and H4K5ac

2. **Chromodomains**:
   - Recognize methylated lysines
   - Found in HP1 (reads H3K9me3)
   - Found in Polycomb proteins

3. **PHD fingers**:
   - Recognize H3K4me3 and H3K4me0
   - Found in many chromatin proteins
   - Can distinguish methylation states

4. **Tudor domains**:
   - Recognize methylated arginines and lysines
   - Found in multiple protein families

5. **MBT domains**:
   - Recognize mono- and di-methylated lysines
   - Found in Polycomb proteins

**Combinatorial complexity**:

- Over 100 different histone modifications identified
- Multiple modifications can occur on same histone tail
- Modifications can influence each other (cross-talk)
- Creates enormous information-coding capacity
- Context matters: same mark, different location = different meaning

**Examples of histone codes**:

| Code | Meaning | Location |
|------|---------|----------|
| H3K4me3 + H3K27me3 | Bivalent/poised | ES cell genes |
| H3K4me3 + H3K9ac + H3K27ac | Active transcription | Active promoters |
| H3K9me3 + H4K20me3 | Constitutive heterochromatin | Repetitive DNA |
| H3K27me3 + H2AK119ub1 | Polycomb silencing | Developmental genes |
| H3K36me3 | Transcription elongation | Gene bodies |

Think of it like:

- Different emoji combinations convey different meanings

- Cells "read" histone modifications to know what to do

- 😊 + 👍 = approval, but 😊 + 😏 = sarcasm!

- Similarly, H3K4me3 + H3K27ac = activate, but H3K4me3 + H3K27me3 = pause

**Evidence and limitations**:

**Supporting evidence**:
- Specific modifications correlate with specific chromatin states
- Reader proteins bind modifications and recruit effector proteins
- Removing modifications changes gene expression predictably

**Limitations and debates**:
- Not all modification combinations have been tested
- Same modifications can have different effects in different contexts
- Some argue it's more about "histone language" than strict "code"
- Redundancy exists—different marks can have similar effects

## Chromatin Structure and Remodeling

### Understanding Chromatin States

Chromatin is not uniform throughout the nucleus—it exists in different states of compaction that directly affect gene expression.

### Euchromatin vs Heterochromatin

**Euchromatin** ("true chromatin"):

**Characteristics**:
- **Loosely packed** chromatin
- **Light-staining** under microscope
- **Transcriptionally active** (genes can be expressed)
- Rich in genes
- Associated with activating histone marks (H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K27ac)
- Typically unmethylated or hypomethylated DNA
- Accessible to transcription factors

**Location**:
- Interior of nucleus
- Gene-rich chromosomal regions
- Active during interphase

Think of euchromatin as **open library stacks**—books (genes) are accessible and can be read.

**Heterochromatin** ("different chromatin"):

**Characteristics**:
- **Tightly packed** chromatin
- **Dark-staining** under microscope
- **Transcriptionally silent** (genes cannot be expressed)
- Gene-poor
- Associated with repressive marks (H3K9me3, H3K27me3, H4K20me3)
- Highly methylated DNA
- Inaccessible to transcription factors

**Two types**:

1. **Constitutive heterochromatin**:
   - Always condensed, all cell types
   - Found at centromeres and telomeres
   - Contains repetitive DNA
   - Structural role
   - Examples: Centromeric repeats, satellite DNA
   - Never transcribed (except specialized RNAs)

2. **Facultative heterochromatin**:
   - Can switch between hetero- and euchromatin
   - Cell type-specific and developmentally regulated
   - Contains genes that CAN be expressed in some contexts
   - Examples: Inactive X chromosome, imprinted genes, tissue-specific silent genes
   - Reversible condensation

Think of heterochromatin as **locked library storage**—books exist but can't be accessed.

**Comparison table**:

| Feature | Euchromatin | Heterochromatin |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Compaction** | Loose | Tight |
| **Staining** | Light | Dark |
| **Transcription** | Active | Silent |
| **DNA methylation** | Low | High |
| **Histone marks** | H3K4me3, H3ac | H3K9me3, H4K20me3 |
| **Replication timing** | Early S phase | Late S phase |
| **Gene density** | High | Low |
| **Accessibility** | High | Low |
| **Location** | Nuclear interior | Nuclear periphery, nucleolus |

**Transitions between states**:

During development and differentiation:
```
Euchromatin ←→ Facultative Heterochromatin
     ↑                    ↑
  (Active)           (Silenced)
     ↑                    ↑
  Gene ON              Gene OFF
```

Constitutive heterochromatin remains stable:
```
Constitutive Heterochromatin (永远 always silenced)
```

### Nucleosome Positioning

**Nucleosome** = DNA wrapped around histone octamer

**Positioning matters**:

- **Where** nucleosomes sit affects gene expression
- **How tightly** DNA wraps affects accessibility
- **Spacing** between nucleosomes matters

**Key regions**:

1. **Nucleosome-Free Regions (NFRs)**:
   - Found at promoters and enhancers
   - Typically 150-200 bp
   - Allow transcription factor binding
   - Mark of active regulatory elements

2. **+1 nucleosome**:
   - First nucleosome downstream of transcription start site (TSS)
   - Often contains H3.3 variant
   - Precisely positioned
   - Marks active genes

3. **-1 nucleosome**:
   - Nucleosome just upstream of TSS
   - Flanks promoter NFR
   - Often has H2A.Z variant

**Determinants of positioning**:

1. **DNA sequence**:
   - Some sequences favor nucleosome formation
   - AT-rich sequences are more flexible
   - Poly(dA:dT) tracts resist nucleosomes
   - Creates intrinsic positioning preferences

2. **Trans-acting factors**:
   - Transcription factors
   - Chromatin remodelers (see below)
   - Pioneer factors that can bind nucleosomal DNA

3. **Histone variants**:
   - H2A.Z, H3.3, H2A.Bbd alter stability
   - Affect positioning and dynamics

4. **Boundary elements**:
   - Insulator proteins (like CTCF)
   - Create barriers to nucleosome spreading

**Dynamic nucleosome landscape**:

```
Inactive gene:
[Nuc][Nuc][Nuc][Nuc][Nuc][Promoter buried][Nuc][Nuc]

↓ Activation signal

Active gene:
[Nuc][Nuc]------[NFR]------[+1]--[Nuc]--[Nuc]--[Nuc]
                 ↑          ↑
             TF binding   TSS
```

### ATP-Dependent Chromatin Remodeling Complexes

**Chromatin remodeling** = Moving, removing, or changing nucleosomes

**Chromatin remodeling complexes** are molecular machines that:

- Slide nucleosomes along DNA
- Eject nucleosomes completely
- Replace histones with variants
- Loosen or tighten chromatin
- Use ATP energy to do so

**Effects**:

- Make DNA accessible (gene ON)
- Make DNA inaccessible (gene OFF)
- Respond to cellular signals

Think of chromatin remodeling like:

- Rearranging furniture to access different parts of a room
- Opening or closing window blinds
- Making space for activities

### Major Remodeling Complex Families

All use ATP as energy source, but have different mechanisms and outcomes.

**1. SWI/SNF Family** (Switch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable)

**Members**: BAF (Brahma-Associated Factors), PBAF complexes in mammals

**Mechanism**:
- Slides and ejects nucleosomes
- Creates nucleosome-free regions

```

### Coordination of Remodeling Activities

**Remodelers work together**:

1. **Sequential action**:

   - Respond to cellular needs

**Example—Gene activation**:
```
1. Signal received
   ↓
2. Transcription factors bind
   ↓
3. HATs recruited → Acetylation
   ↓
4. SWI/SNF recruited → Nucleosome ejection
   ↓
5. Pol II recruited → Transcription begins
   ↓
6. CHD1 recruited by H3K4me3 → Maintains open state
   ↓
7. ISWI organizes nucleosomes in gene body
```

## Non-Coding RNA-Mediated Regulation

### RNA Molecules That Control Genes

Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play crucial roles in epigenetic regulation! Unlike mRNA that codes for proteins, these RNAs have regulatory functions.

**Key concept**: ncRNAs guide, recruit, and regulate epigenetic machinery to specific genomic locations.

### MicroRNAs (miRNAs)

**What they are**:

- Small RNA molecules (~22 nucleotides long)
- Single-stranded
- Evolutionarily conserved
- Over 2,000 miRNAs in humans

**How they're made**:

1. **Transcription**: 
   - RNA Pol II transcribes pri-miRNA (primary miRNA)
   - Can be from intergenic regions or introns

2. **Nuclear processing**:
   - Drosha enzyme cuts pri-miRNA → pre-miRNA (~70 nt hairpin)
   - DGCR8 protein helps Drosha recognize correct sites

3. **Export**:
   - Exportin-5 transports pre-miRNA to cytoplasm

4. **Cytoplasmic processing**:
   - Dicer enzyme cuts pre-miRNA → mature miRNA duplex
   - One strand selected as guide strand

5. **RISC assembly**:
   - Guide strand loaded into RISC (RNA-Induced Silencing Complex)
   - Argonaute (AGO) protein is catalytic component

**What they do**:

- Bind to complementary sequences in mRNA (usually 3' UTR)
- **Perfect match**: mRNA cleavage (rare in animals)
- **Imperfect match**: Translation repression (common)

## Epigenomics

### Studying Epigenetic Marks Genome-Wide

**Epigenomics** = Studying all epigenetic marks across the entire genome

Like proteomics studies all proteins, epigenomics studies all epigenetic modifications!

### Techniques in Epigenomics

**1. Bisulfite Sequencing**:

- Detects DNA methylation

- Treats DNA with bisulfite (changes unmethylated C to U)

- Methylated C stays as C

- Sequence and compare!

**2. ChIP-seq** (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation + Sequencing):

- Detects histone modifications

- Uses antibodies to pull down modified histones

- Sequence the attached DNA

- Map where modifications are genome-wide

**3. ATAC-seq** (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin):

- Finds open (accessible) chromatin regions

- Open chromatin = active genes

- Closed chromatin = silenced genes

## Differences in Prokaryotic vs. Eukaryotic Epigenomes

### Prokaryotes: Limited Epigenetics

**Prokaryotes have**:

- DNA methylation (but different purposes)

- No histones (so no histone modifications)

- Simpler regulation

**Prokaryotic methylation**:

- Protects DNA from restriction enzymes

- Helps DNA replication timing

- Some gene regulation

### Eukaryotes: Complex Epigenetics

**Eukaryotes have**:

- Extensive DNA methylation

- Many histone modifications

- Chromatin remodeling

- Non-coding RNAs

- Complex epigenetic inheritance

**Why the difference?**

- Eukaryotes need more sophisticated regulation

- Multicellular organisms need cell type identity

- Complex development requires epigenetic memory

## Epigenetics and Environment

### Nature AND Nurture

Epigenetics is the bridge between genes and environment!

**Environmental factors that affect epigenetics**:

- **Diet**: Nutrients affect methylation patterns

- **Stress**: Changes chromatin structure

- **Toxins**: Can alter epigenetic marks

- **Exercise**: Modifies histones in muscle

- **Social interaction**: Affects brain epigenetics

**Famous examples**:

**1. Dutch Hunger Winter (1944-1945)**:

- Pregnant women experienced famine

- Their children had epigenetic changes

- These changes persisted into adulthood

- Even affected grandchildren!

**2. Agouti Mouse Experiment**:

- Mother mice fed different diets

- Offspring had different coat colors

- Same genes, different epigenetic marks!

- Diet changed epigenetics, which changed appearance

**3. Bee Development**:

- Queen bees and worker bees have identical DNA

- Different diets (royal jelly vs. regular food)

- Different epigenetic patterns

- Completely different bodies and behaviors!

## Epigenetic Inheritance

### Passing On More Than Just DNA

Can epigenetic marks be inherited? **Sometimes, YES!**

### Types of Epigenetic Inheritance

**1. Mitotic inheritance** (cell division):

- Epigenetic marks copied when cells divide

- How liver cells stay liver cells

- Normal and common!

**2. Transgenerational inheritance** (across generations):

- Some epigenetic marks passed from parent to offspring

- More controversial

- Happens in plants and worms

- Rare in mammals

**Reset mechanisms**:

- Most epigenetic marks are erased during reproduction

- Prevents inheriting temporary changes

- Some marks escape erasure!

## Epigenetics and Disease

### When Epigenetics Goes Wrong

**Cancer**:

- Abnormal DNA methylation

- Tumor suppressor genes get silenced

- Oncogenes get activated

- Epigenetic drugs can help!

**Developmental Disorders**:

- Imprinting disorders (Prader-Willi, Angelman syndromes)

- Rett syndrome (affects histone modifications)

- Fragile X syndrome (abnormal methylation)

**Aging**:

- Epigenetic marks change with age

- "Epigenetic clock" can predict biological age

- Some age-related changes are reversible!

**Neurological Disorders**:

- Alzheimer's disease

- Depression (responds to environment via epigenetics)

- Addiction (epigenetic changes in brain)

## Epigenetic Therapies

### Reversing Epigenetic Changes

Unlike DNA mutations, epigenetic changes are **potentially reversible**!

**Epigenetic drugs**:

- **DNMT inhibitors**: Block DNA methylation

- **HDAC inhibitors**: Affect histone acetylation

- Already used to treat some cancers!

**Future therapies**:

- Editing epigenetic marks precisely

- Reversing age-related changes

- Treating complex diseases

## Key Takeaways
