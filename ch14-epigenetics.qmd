# Epigenetics and Epigenomics

## Beyond the DNA Sequence

### What Is Epigenetics?

**Epigenetics** studies changes in gene activity that DON'T change the DNA sequence itself.

**The word "epigenetic" means**:

- **Epi** = above or on top of

- **Genetic** = relating to genes

- So: "Above genetics" or "On top of genes"

Think of it like:

- DNA = the words in a book

- Epigenetics = highlighting, bookmarks, and notes that change how you read the book

- Same words, but different reading experience!

### Why Epigenetics Matters

**The Big Question**: If all your cells have the same DNA, why are they different?

- Brain cells and muscle cells have identical DNA

- But they look and act completely different!

- **Answer**: Epigenetics!

Epigenetic marks determine:

- Which genes are turned ON in each cell type

- Which genes are turned OFF

- How cells remember their identity

- How cells respond to the environment

## DNA Methylation

### Adding Chemical Tags to DNA

**DNA methylation** = Adding a methyl group (CH₃) to DNA

**Where it happens**:

- Usually on cytosine (C) bases

- Specifically in "CpG" sequences (C next to G)

- "p" stands for the phosphate between them

**What it looks like**:

- Normal: Cytosine (C)

- Methylated: 5-methylcytosine (5mC)

- Same base, just with a tiny chemical decoration

Think of it like:

- Putting a sticker on a letter

- The letter is still there and readable

- But the sticker changes how it's treated

### Effects of DNA Methylation

**Generally, methylation = Gene is OFF**:

- Methyl groups block proteins from reading genes

- Recruit proteins that compact chromatin

- Like putting a "Do Not Disturb" sign on a door

**Where methylation happens**:

- **Gene promoters**: Methylation → gene silenced

- **Gene bodies**: Methylation → can actually increase expression!

- **Repetitive DNA**: Methylation → keeps it quiet (good thing!)

### CpG Islands

**CpG islands** = Regions with lots of CpG sequences

**Key facts**:

- Found near gene promoters

- Usually UN-methylated (genes are ready to be expressed)

- If they GET methylated → gene is turned off

- Important for gene regulation

**Examples**:

- **Cancer**: Tumor suppressor genes get abnormally methylated → cancer

- **Development**: Methylation patterns change as embryo develops

- **X-inactivation**: Methylation silences one X chromosome in females

### DNA Methylation in Development

**During development**:

1. **Fertilization**: Most methylation erased (reset!)

2. **Early embryo**: New methylation patterns established

3. **Different cell types**: Different methylation patterns

4. **Maintained**: Patterns copied when cells divide

Think of it like:

- Resetting a computer (fertilization)

- Installing new software (development)

- Keeping settings when you save (cell division)

## Histone Modifications

### Decorating the Histone Proteins

Remember histones? DNA wraps around them like thread on spools.

**Histone modifications** = Adding or removing chemical groups to histone proteins

**Where modifications occur**:

- Histone "tails" sticking out from nucleosomes

- Like ribbons on wrapped presents

### Types of Histone Modifications

**1. Acetylation** (adding acetyl groups):

- **Effect**: Loosens chromatin, gene activation

- **Where**: Lysine amino acids

- **Think of it as**: Opening the curtains to let in light

**2. Methylation** (adding methyl groups):

- **Effect**: Can activate OR repress genes (depends on location!)

- **Where**: Lysine or arginine amino acids

- **Complex**: Different methylation patterns mean different things

**3. Phosphorylation** (adding phosphate groups):

- **Effect**: Various effects depending on location

- **Important for**: Cell division, DNA repair

**4. Ubiquitination** (adding ubiquitin protein):

- **Effect**: Can activate or repress genes

- **Also can**: Mark histones for degradation

### The Histone Code

**The "histone code" hypothesis**:

- Different combinations of modifications send different signals

- Like a complex language written on histones

- Specific proteins "read" these marks and respond accordingly

**Examples**:

- **H3K4me3** (Histone 3, Lysine 4, tri-methylation) → Gene activation

- **H3K27me3** (Histone 3, Lysine 27, tri-methylation) → Gene repression

- **H3K9ac** (Histone 3, Lysine 9, acetylation) → Gene activation

Think of it like:

- Different emoji combinations convey different meanings

- Cells "read" histone modifications to know what to do

## Chromatin Remodeling

### Rearranging the Packaging

**Chromatin remodeling** = Moving, removing, or changing nucleosomes

**Chromatin remodeling complexes** are molecular machines that:

- Slide nucleosomes along DNA

- Eject nucleosomes completely

- Replace histones with variants

- Loosen or tighten chromatin

**Effects**:

- Make DNA accessible (gene ON)

- Make DNA inaccessible (gene OFF)

- Respond to cellular signals

Think of chromatin remodeling like:

- Rearranging furniture to access different parts of a room

- Opening or closing window blinds

- Making space for activities

## Non-Coding RNAs in Epigenetics

### RNA Molecules That Control Genes

Non-coding RNAs play important roles in epigenetic regulation!

### MicroRNAs (miRNAs)

**What they do**:

- Bind to mRNA

- Block protein production

- Cause mRNA degradation

**How it's epigenetic**:

- Changes gene expression without changing DNA

- Can be inherited (passed to daughter cells)

- Responds to environment

### Long Non-Coding RNAs (lncRNAs)

**What they do**:

- Guide epigenetic modifying proteins to specific genes

- Organize chromatin structure

- Regulate transcription

**Famous example - XIST**:

- Long non-coding RNA

- Coats one X chromosome in females

- Recruits silencing machinery

- Shuts down entire chromosome!

This is **X-inactivation** - how females silence one X chromosome!

## Epigenomics

### Studying Epigenetic Marks Genome-Wide

**Epigenomics** = Studying all epigenetic marks across the entire genome

Like proteomics studies all proteins, epigenomics studies all epigenetic modifications!

### Techniques in Epigenomics

**1. Bisulfite Sequencing**:

- Detects DNA methylation

- Treats DNA with bisulfite (changes unmethylated C to U)

- Methylated C stays as C

- Sequence and compare!

**2. ChIP-seq** (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation + Sequencing):

- Detects histone modifications

- Uses antibodies to pull down modified histones

- Sequence the attached DNA

- Map where modifications are genome-wide

**3. ATAC-seq** (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin):

- Finds open (accessible) chromatin regions

- Open chromatin = active genes

- Closed chromatin = silenced genes

## Differences in Prokaryotic vs. Eukaryotic Epigenomes

### Prokaryotes: Limited Epigenetics

**Prokaryotes have**:

- DNA methylation (but different purposes)

- No histones (so no histone modifications)

- Simpler regulation

**Prokaryotic methylation**:

- Protects DNA from restriction enzymes

- Helps DNA replication timing

- Some gene regulation

### Eukaryotes: Complex Epigenetics

**Eukaryotes have**:

- Extensive DNA methylation

- Many histone modifications

- Chromatin remodeling

- Non-coding RNAs

- Complex epigenetic inheritance

**Why the difference?**

- Eukaryotes need more sophisticated regulation

- Multicellular organisms need cell type identity

- Complex development requires epigenetic memory

## Epigenetics and Environment

### Nature AND Nurture

Epigenetics is the bridge between genes and environment!

**Environmental factors that affect epigenetics**:

- **Diet**: Nutrients affect methylation patterns

- **Stress**: Changes chromatin structure

- **Toxins**: Can alter epigenetic marks

- **Exercise**: Modifies histones in muscle

- **Social interaction**: Affects brain epigenetics

**Famous examples**:

**1. Dutch Hunger Winter (1944-1945)**:

- Pregnant women experienced famine

- Their children had epigenetic changes

- These changes persisted into adulthood

- Even affected grandchildren!

**2. Agouti Mouse Experiment**:

- Mother mice fed different diets

- Offspring had different coat colors

- Same genes, different epigenetic marks!

- Diet changed epigenetics, which changed appearance

**3. Bee Development**:

- Queen bees and worker bees have identical DNA

- Different diets (royal jelly vs. regular food)

- Different epigenetic patterns

- Completely different bodies and behaviors!

## Epigenetic Inheritance

### Passing On More Than Just DNA

Can epigenetic marks be inherited? **Sometimes, YES!**

### Types of Epigenetic Inheritance

**1. Mitotic inheritance** (cell division):

- Epigenetic marks copied when cells divide

- How liver cells stay liver cells

- Normal and common!

**2. Transgenerational inheritance** (across generations):

- Some epigenetic marks passed from parent to offspring

- More controversial

- Happens in plants and worms

- Rare in mammals

**Reset mechanisms**:

- Most epigenetic marks are erased during reproduction

- Prevents inheriting temporary changes

- Some marks escape erasure!

## Epigenetics and Disease

### When Epigenetics Goes Wrong

**Cancer**:

- Abnormal DNA methylation

- Tumor suppressor genes get silenced

- Oncogenes get activated

- Epigenetic drugs can help!

**Developmental Disorders**:

- Imprinting disorders (Prader-Willi, Angelman syndromes)

- Rett syndrome (affects histone modifications)

- Fragile X syndrome (abnormal methylation)

**Aging**:

- Epigenetic marks change with age

- "Epigenetic clock" can predict biological age

- Some age-related changes are reversible!

**Neurological Disorders**:

- Alzheimer's disease

- Depression (responds to environment via epigenetics)

- Addiction (epigenetic changes in brain)

## Epigenetic Therapies

### Reversing Epigenetic Changes

Unlike DNA mutations, epigenetic changes are **potentially reversible**!

**Epigenetic drugs**:

- **DNMT inhibitors**: Block DNA methylation

- **HDAC inhibitors**: Affect histone acetylation

- Already used to treat some cancers!

**Future therapies**:

- Editing epigenetic marks precisely

- Reversing age-related changes

- Treating complex diseases
