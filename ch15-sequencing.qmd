# Sequencing Technologies

## Reading the Book of Life

### What Is DNA Sequencing?

**DNA sequencing** = Reading the order of A, T, G, and C letters in DNA

Think of it like:
- Reading the text in a book, letter by letter
- Decoding a secret message
- Reading the instruction manual of life!

## From Sanger to Next-Generation Sequencing

### The First Method: Sanger Sequencing (1977)

**Developed by**: Frederick Sanger (won his 2nd Nobel Prize for this!)

**How it works (simplified)**:
1. Start with DNA template
2. Add special labeled nucleotides that STOP copying when incorporated
3. Create DNA fragments of different lengths
4. Separate fragments by size
5. Read the sequence from the pattern!

**Characteristics**:
- **Accurate**: 99.99% accuracy!
- **Slow**: One sequence at a time
- **Expensive**: Cost millions for whole genomes
- **Read length**: Up to ~1,000 base pairs per read

**Impact**:
- Used for the Human Genome Project!
- Still used today for small-scale sequencing
- Gold standard for accuracy

**The Human Genome Project timeline**:
- Started: 1990
- Finished: 2003
- Cost: $3 billion
- Time: 13 years
- Method: Sanger sequencing

That's $1 per base pair!

### The Revolution: Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)

**What changed**: In the mid-2000s, new technologies emerged!

**NGS characteristics**:
- **Massively parallel**: Sequence millions of fragments simultaneously!
- **Fast**: Whole genome in days instead of years
- **Cheap**: Now costs less than $1,000 per genome
- **High-throughput**: Generate billions of base pairs of data

**Key difference from Sanger**:
- Sanger: Read ONE sequence at a time (serial)
- NGS: Read MILLIONS of sequences at once (parallel)

Think of it like:
- **Sanger**: Reading one book
- **NGS**: Reading an entire library simultaneously!

### How NGS Works (General Process)

**1. Library Preparation**:
- Break DNA into small fragments
- Add special "adapters" to fragment ends
- Like putting address labels on letters

**2. Amplification**:
- Make many copies of each fragment
- Like photocopying letters many times

**3. Sequencing**:
- Fragments attach to a surface
- Nucleotides added one at a time
- Each nucleotide emits light (different colors for A, T, G, C)
- Camera records the lights
- Computer determines sequence!

**4. Data Analysis**:
- Assemble millions of short sequences
- Like putting together a jigsaw puzzle
- Compare to reference genome
- Identify differences

### NGS Platforms

**Illumina** (most popular):
- Short reads (100-300 bp)
- Very accurate
- Most widely used
- Relatively cheap

**Ion Torrent**:
- Detects pH changes (not light)
- Faster
- Good for targeted sequencing

**Others**: Many platforms exist, each with trade-offs!

## Human Genome Sequencing: Then vs. Now

### The Amazing Progress

| Feature | 2003 (HGP) | 2025 (Today) |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| **Cost** | $3 billion | <$1,000 |
| **Time** | 13 years | 1-2 days |
| **Method** | Sanger sequencing | NGS (Illumina) |
| **Accuracy** | 99.99% | 99.9% |
| **Availability** | Research only | Clinical & consumer |

**That's a reduction of**:
- Cost: **3 million-fold**!
- Time: **2,000-fold**!

It's like going from a price of a house to a coffee!

## Third-Generation Sequencing

### Long-Read Technologies

**Problem with NGS (2nd gen)**:
