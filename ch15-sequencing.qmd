# Sequencing Technologies

## Reading the Book of Life

### What Is DNA Sequencing?

**DNA sequencing** = Reading the order of A, T, G, and C letters in DNA

Think of it like:

- Reading the text in a book, letter by letter

- Decoding a secret message

- Reading the instruction manual of life!

## From Sanger to Next-Generation Sequencing

### The First Method: Sanger Sequencing (1977)

**Developed by**: Frederick Sanger (won his 2nd Nobel Prize for this!) [@sanger1977dna]

**How it works (simplified)**:

1. Start with DNA template

2. Add special labeled nucleotides that STOP copying when incorporated

3. Create DNA fragments of different lengths

4. Separate fragments by size

5. Read the sequence from the pattern!

**Characteristics**:

- **Accurate**: 99.99% accuracy!

- **Slow**: One sequence at a time

- **Expensive**: Cost millions for whole genomes

- **Read length**: Up to ~1,000 base pairs per read

**Impact**:

- Used for the Human Genome Project!

- Still used today for small-scale sequencing

- Gold standard for accuracy

**The Human Genome Project timeline**:

- **Started**: 1990

- **Finished**: 2003

- **Cost**: $3 billion

- **Time**: 13 years

- **Method**: Sanger sequencing

That's $1 per base pair!

### Sanger Sequencing: The Detailed Mechanism

#### The Biological Foundation

Sanger sequencing is based on **semi-conservative DNA replication** - the same process cells use to copy DNA.

**What is semi-conservative replication?**

Think of DNA like a zipper with two sides:

- One side stays (the template)

- One new side is built (the copy)

- The old side guides making the new side

**Key facts**:

- DNA replication needs a template strand

- One strand serves as the template (parent)

- A new strand is built matching the template (daughter)

- Watson and Crick predicted this in 1953

- Meselson-Stahl proved it in 1958

#### Why DNA Polymerase Needs a Primer

This is an important question! Here's the simple answer:

**The problem**:

- **RNA polymerase** → Can start making RNA from nothing

- **DNA polymerase** → Cannot start from nothing, needs a primer first

**Why the difference?**

Think of it like starting a zipper:

- RNA polymerase is like a self-starting zipper

- DNA polymerase is like a zipper that needs the first tooth in place

**Three reasons DNA polymerase needs a primer**:

**Reason 1: Error checking**

- DNA polymerase checks each base it adds (proofreading)

- It needs something to hold onto to check properly

- Like needing a ruler to measure accurately

- RNA polymerase doesn't check as carefully (RNA is temporary anyway)

**Reason 2: Chemical differences**

- RNA polymerase uses NTPs (have an extra -OH group)

- DNA polymerase uses dNTPs (missing that -OH group)

- That extra -OH helps start from nothing

- DNA polymerase lost this ability during evolution

**Reason 3: Accuracy matters**

- DNA is permanent → needs to be perfect

- Primer gives DNA polymerase a stable starting point

- Like building a house - you need a foundation first

- This reduces copying errors

**Why this matters**:

- **PCR** → Needs primers to work

- **Sanger sequencing** → Needs primers to work

- **Cell DNA replication** → Uses RNA primers (made by primase enzyme)

### The Chemistry of Sanger Sequencing

#### The Special Ingredients

Sanger sequencing uses TWO types of building blocks:

**1. Normal dNTPs (regular DNA building blocks)**:

- **What they are**: dATP, dTTP, dGTP, dCTP

- **What they do**: Build DNA normally

- **Key feature**: Have a 3'-OH group

- **Result**: DNA chain keeps growing

**2. Special ddNTPs (chain terminators)**:

- **What they are**: ddATP, ddTTP, ddGTP, ddCTP

- **What they do**: STOP DNA growth when added

- **Key feature**: MISSING the 3'-OH group

- **Result**: DNA chain stops immediately

- **Bonus**: Each is labeled with a different fluorescent color

  - ddA = Green

  - ddT = Red

  - ddG = Yellow

  - ddC = Blue

#### The Simple Difference

**Normal dNTP** (keeps going):

```
Has -OH group → Next base can attach → Chain grows
```

```

**Special ddNTP** (stops):
```

```
NO -OH group → Next base CANNOT attach → Chain stops
```

```

Think of it like:

- Normal dNTP = Lego brick with connectors on top

- Special ddNTP = Lego brick with flat top (nothing can attach)

#### How Sanger Sequencing Works (Step by Step)

Let's sequence this DNA: `5'-TACGGCATGCTA-3'`

**Step 1: Add primer**

The primer tells DNA polymerase where to start:
```

```
Template DNA: 5'---TACGGCATGCTA---3'
Primer:            3'-ATGC-5'
                       ↑
                  Start here!
```

```

**Step 2: Add the mixture**

We add:

- **LOTS** of normal dNTPs (A, T, G, C)

- **A FEW** special ddNTPs (ddA, ddT, ddG, ddC) with colors

**Step 3: DNA polymerase starts copying**

Sometimes it adds a normal base → keeps going
Sometimes it adds a special colored base → STOPS

This creates fragments of different lengths:
```

```
Fragment 1: 3'-ATGCCGddT-5'      (Stopped at position 7, RED)
Fragment 2: 3'-ATGCCGTAddC-5'    (Stopped at position 8, BLUE)
Fragment 3: 3'-ATGCCGTACddG-5'   (Stopped at position 9, YELLOW)
Fragment 4: 3'-ATGCCGTACGddA-5'  (Stopped at position 10, GREEN)
Fragment 5: 3'-ATGCCGTACGAddT-5' (Stopped at position 11, RED)
```

```

Each fragment ends with a colored base!

**Step 4: Separate by size**

- Pour fragments through a thin tube

- Small fragments run fast → detected first

- Large fragments run slow → detected last

- Like a race where smaller runners are faster

**Step 5: Read the colors**

Camera sees colors in order:
```

```
Position 7:  RED    → T was added
Position 8:  BLUE   → C was added
Position 9:  YELLOW → G was added
Position 10: GREEN  → A was added
Position 11: RED    → T was added

Sequence = TCGAT...
```

```

Done! We just read the DNA sequence!

### Modern Sanger Sequencing Protocol

**Workflow**:

**Step 1: PCR Amplification** (optional but common):

- Amplify target region

- Purify PCR product

- Ensures enough template

**Step 2: Sequencing Reaction**:

- Mix template DNA + sequencing primer

- Add DNA polymerase (thermostable, e.g., Taq)

- Add mix of dNTPs and fluorescent-labeled ddNTPs

- Thermal cycling (like PCR, but linear amplification)

**Typical mix ratio**:

- dNTPs:ddNTPs = ~100:1

- Ensures most reactions continue

- But some terminate at each position

**Step 3: Cleanup**:

- Remove excess ddNTPs

- Remove salts (interfere with electrophoresis)

- Use spin columns or magnetic beads

**Step 4: Capillary Electrophoresis**:

- Inject sample into capillary

- Apply electric field

- Fragments separate by size

- Laser excites fluorophores

- Camera detects emission

**Step 5: Data Analysis**:

- Software converts peaks to sequence

- Quality scores assigned to each base

- Generate chromatogram (peak visualization)

### Reading a Sanger Chromatogram

**What you see**:
```

```
      A    G    C    T    A    G    C    T
      |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |
     Peak Peak Peak Peak Peak Peak Peak Peak
```

```

**Quality indicators**:

**Good quality**:

- Sharp, well-separated peaks

- Single color at each position

- Uniform peak height

- High signal-to-noise ratio

**Poor quality**:

- Overlapping peaks (multiple colors)

- Broad peaks

- Low peak height

- Often at start (primer) or end (long reads) of sequence

**Phred quality score**:

- Q20 = 99% accuracy (1 error in 100 bases)

- Q30 = 99.9% accuracy (1 error in 1,000 bases)

- Most modern Sanger reads Q30 for first 700-800 bp

### Semi-Conservative Replication Revisited

**Meselson-Stahl Experiment (1958)** proved semi-conservative replication:

**Experiment**:

1. Grow E. coli in heavy nitrogen (¹⁵N) medium

2. DNA becomes "heavy" (labeled)

3. Switch to normal nitrogen (¹⁴N) medium

4. After one replication: DNA is "hybrid" (one heavy, one light strand)

5. After two replications: Half hybrid, half light

**Result**: Proved DNA replicates semi-conservatively

- One template strand conserved

- One new strand synthesized

**This principle underlies**:

- All DNA replication in cells

- PCR amplification

- Sanger sequencing

- All DNA synthesis!

**Connection to Sanger sequencing**:

- Template strand = original DNA

- Newly synthesized strand = sequence read

- ddNTPs terminate synthesis at random positions

- Pattern reveals template sequence

### Why Semi-Conservative Replication Matters for Sequencing

**Advantages**:

1. **Accuracy**: Template strand provides perfect guide

2. **Complementarity**: A pairs with T, G pairs with C

3. **Proofreading**: DNA polymerase checks each base

4. **Reliability**: Same template gives same sequence

**Fidelity**:

- DNA polymerase error rate: ~1 in 10⁷ (with proofreading)

- Sanger sequencing error rate: ~1 in 10⁴ (due to termination randomness)

- Still extremely accurate!

### Sanger Sequencing Applications Today

**Despite NGS dominance, Sanger still used for**:

**1. Variant Validation**:

- NGS finds potential mutation

- Sanger confirms it

- Gold standard for clinical diagnostics

**2. Small-Scale Projects**:

- Sequencing few genes

- Checking clones

- Verifying plasmids

- More cost-effective than NGS setup

**3. Long Reads**:

- Up to 1,000 bp in single read

- NGS reads much shorter (typically 150-300 bp)

- Useful for spanning repetitive regions

**4. Low-Throughput Needs**:

- 1-96 samples at a time

- Don't need millions of reads

- Academic labs, clinical labs

### Limitations of Sanger Sequencing

**Compared to NGS**:

- **Throughput**: Only 96 samples/run vs. millions in NGS

- **Cost**: $5-10 per reaction vs. $0.01 per Mb for NGS

- **Speed**: Hours per sample vs. days for whole genome (but millions of sequences!)

- **Scalability**: Cannot do whole genomes economically

**When NOT to use Sanger**:

- Whole genome sequencing

- RNA-seq experiments

- ChIP-seq experiments

- Metagenomics

- Any high-throughput application

### Historical Impact

**Before Sanger sequencing** (pre-1977):

- No way to read DNA sequence directly

- Relied on protein sequencing (slower, harder)

- Genetic code deciphered with difficulty

**After Sanger sequencing** (1977-2005):

- First genes sequenced

- First genomes sequenced (viruses, bacteria)

- **Human Genome Project possible**!

- Molecular biology revolution

- Medical genetics born

**Key milestones using Sanger**:

- 1977: First DNA sequence (bacteriophage φX174, 5,375 bp)

- 1995: First bacterial genome (H. influenzae, 1.8 Mb)

- 1996: First eukaryotic genome (yeast, 12 Mb)

- 2001: Human genome draft (3 Gb!)

- 2003: Human genome complete

**Nobel Prizes related to sequencing**:

- 2020: Charpentier & Doudna - CRISPR (genome editing, relies on sequencing)

### Comparison Table: Sanger vs. NGS

| Feature | Sanger Sequencing | Next-Generation Sequencing |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| **Read length** | 700-1,000 bp | 100-300 bp (Illumina) |
| **Accuracy** | 99.9% (Q30) | 99%+ (depends on platform) |
| **Throughput** | 1-96 sequences/run | Millions to billions/run |
| **Cost per Mb** | $500-1,000 | $0.01-0.10 |
| **Time** | Hours | Days (for whole genome) |
| **Applications** | Validation, cloning, small projects | WGS, RNA-seq, variant discovery |
| **Best for** | Low throughput, long reads | High throughput, discovery |

### The Revolution: Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)

**What changed**: In the mid-2000s, new technologies emerged!

**NGS characteristics**:

- **Massively parallel**: Sequence millions of fragments simultaneously!

- **Fast**: Whole genome in days instead of years

- **Cheap**: Now costs less than $1,000 per genome

- **High-throughput**: Generate billions of base pairs of data

**Key difference from Sanger**:

- Sanger: Read ONE sequence at a time (serial)

- NGS: Read MILLIONS of sequences at once (parallel)

Think of it like:

- **Sanger**: Reading one book

- **NGS**: Reading an entire library simultaneously!

### How NGS Works (General Process)

**1. Library Preparation**:

- Break DNA into small fragments

- Add special "adapters" to fragment ends

- Like putting address labels on letters

**2. Amplification**:

- Make many copies of each fragment

- Like photocopying letters many times

**3. Sequencing**:

- Fragments attach to a surface

- Nucleotides added one at a time

- Each nucleotide emits light (different colors for A, T, G, C)

- Camera records the lights

- Computer determines sequence!

**4. Data Analysis**:

- Assemble millions of short sequences

- Like putting together a jigsaw puzzle

- Compare to reference genome

- Identify differences

### NGS Platforms

**Illumina** (most popular):

- Short reads (100-300 bp)

- Very accurate

- Most widely used

- Relatively cheap

**Ion Torrent**:

- Detects pH changes (not light)

- Faster

- Good for targeted sequencing

**Others**: Many platforms exist, each with trade-offs!

## Illumina Sequencing: The Details

### Why Illumina Dominates NGS

**Illumina/Solexa sequencing** is the most widely used NGS technology today. It was developed by Solexa (acquired by Illumina in 2007) and has become the gold standard for high-throughput sequencing [@bentley2008accurate].

**Key advantages**:

- **Massively parallel**: Sequence millions of DNA fragments simultaneously
- **High accuracy**: 99%+ accuracy with quality scores
- **Cost-effective**: Cheapest per-base cost
- **Versatile**: Used for genome sequencing, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and more

### The Core Principle: Sequencing by Synthesis (SBS)

Illumina uses **sequencing by synthesis (SBS)** - it sequences DNA by watching DNA polymerase add nucleotides one at a time!

**The brilliant idea**:

- Use special fluorescent nucleotides
- Each base (A, T, G, C) glows a different color
- Watch which color appears → know which base was added
- Repeat for every position in the DNA!

Think of it like:

- DNA polymerase is building a LEGO tower
- Each LEGO brick glows a different color
- A camera takes a picture after each brick is added
- The color sequence reveals the DNA sequence!

### The Magic Ingredient: Reversible Terminator Nucleotides

**Normal dNTPs** (regular DNA building blocks):

- DNA polymerase can add them continuously
- Hard to control - might add multiple bases at once

**Illumina's reversible terminators**:

- **Modified dNTPs** with two special features:
  1. **Fluorescent dye** attached (different color for A, T, G, C)
  2. **Reversible terminator** group at 3' position

**How they work**:

1. DNA polymerase adds ONE modified nucleotide
2. The terminator BLOCKS the next base from being added
3. Camera captures the fluorescent signal
4. Enzymes REMOVE the fluorescent dye and terminator
5. Next cycle begins!

**The four colors**:

- **Adenine (A)**: Green fluorescence
- **Thymine (T)**: Red fluorescence
- **Guanine (G)**: Yellow fluorescence
- **Cytosine (C)**: Blue fluorescence

(Note: Exact colors vary by Illumina platform, but each base has a unique signal)

### Step-by-Step: How Illumina Sequencing Works

#### Step 1: Library Preparation

**Goal**: Prepare DNA fragments with special adapters

**Process**:

1. **Fragment DNA**: Break genomic DNA into small pieces (typically 200-500 bp)
   - Use enzymes (restriction enzymes) OR
   - Physical shearing (sonication, nebulization)

2. **Repair ends**: Make fragment ends smooth and blunt

3. **Add adapters**: Attach short DNA sequences to both ends
   - Adapter sequence is known
   - Contains binding sites for primers
   - Allows fragments to attach to flow cell

**Why adapters matter**:

- Let fragments stick to flow cell surface
- Provide primer binding sites for sequencing
- Add barcodes (for multiplexing - mixing multiple samples)

#### Step 2: Cluster Generation (Bridge Amplification)

**The flow cell**:

- Glass slide with millions of tiny spots
- Each spot has oligonucleotides (short DNA sequences) attached
- These oligos match the adapter sequences

**Bridge amplification process**:

1. **Attach**: DNA fragment binds to flow cell via adapter
2. **Bend**: Fragment bends over and binds to nearby oligo (makes a "bridge")
3. **Amplify**: DNA polymerase copies the fragment
4. **Separate**: Double-stranded DNA is denatured (separated)
5. **Repeat**: Process repeats ~30-35 times

**Result**: Each single DNA molecule becomes a "cluster" of ~1,000 identical copies in one tiny spot!

**Why clustering is brilliant**:

- **Signal amplification**: 1,000 copies glow much brighter than 1 molecule
- **Accuracy**: All copies in cluster have same sequence
- **Millions of clusters**: Each original DNA fragment gets its own cluster
- **Parallel sequencing**: All clusters sequenced simultaneously!

Think of it like:

- One person shouting = hard to hear
- 1,000 people shouting the same thing = very loud and clear!

#### Step 3: Sequencing by Synthesis

**Now the actual sequencing begins**!

**Cycle 1: Add first base**

1. **Add mix** to flow cell:
   - All four fluorescent reversible terminator dNTPs (A, T, G, C)
   - DNA polymerase
   - Sequencing primer (binds to adapter)

2. **Incorporation**:
   - DNA polymerase adds ONE base to each cluster
   - Only the complementary base binds
   - Terminator prevents adding more bases

3. **Wash**: Remove unincorporated nucleotides

4. **Image**:
   - Laser excites fluorescent dyes
   - Camera captures emission from each cluster
   - Computer records which color (which base)

5. **Cleave**:
   - Enzymes remove fluorescent dye
   - Enzymes remove terminator group
   - 3'-OH is restored for next cycle

**Cycle 2: Add second base**

- Repeat exact same process
- Add second base
- Image the color
- Record the base

**Cycles 3, 4, 5... up to 150-300 cycles**:

- Continue adding one base at a time
- Image each cycle
- Build up the complete sequence!

**Key features**:

- **One base per cycle**: Reversible terminators prevent errors from homopolymers (like AAAAA)
- **All four dNTPs present**: Natural competition minimizes bias
- **Massively parallel**: Millions of clusters sequenced simultaneously

#### Step 4: Data Analysis and Base Calling

**What happens to the images**:

1. **Image analysis**: Software identifies each cluster spot

2. **Intensity measurement**: Measures fluorescence intensity and color for each cluster

3. **Base calling**: Determines which base (A, T, G, C) was added
   - Compares signal to expected wavelengths
   - Assigns most likely base

4. **Quality scoring**: Assigns confidence score (Phred score) to each base
   - **Q20** = 99% accuracy (1 error in 100 bases)
   - **Q30** = 99.9% accuracy (1 error in 1,000 bases)
   - **Q40** = 99.99% accuracy (1 error in 10,000 bases)

5. **FASTQ file generation**: Creates file with:
   - Read sequence
   - Quality score for each base
   - Read identifier

**Quality control**:

- Low-quality reads filtered out
- Adapter sequences trimmed
- Reads ready for alignment or assembly!

### Paired-End Sequencing

**Even more powerful**: Illumina can sequence BOTH ends of each DNA fragment!

**How it works**:

1. Sequence one end (forward read, 150 bp)
2. Wash away sequencing reagents
3. Perform bridge amplification again to regenerate clusters
4. Sequence the OTHER end (reverse read, 150 bp)

**Advantages**:

- **Better mapping**: Know exact distance between two ends
- **Detect rearrangements**: Identify insertions, deletions, inversions
- **Span repetitive regions**: One end maps uniquely, helps place the other
- **Improved accuracy**: Two reads better than one

**Applications**:

- **Genome assembly**: Connect contigs
- **Variant detection**: Find structural variants
- **RNA-seq**: Identify splice junctions
- **Metagenomics**: Better species identification

### Illumina Platforms Comparison

## Third-Generation Sequencing

### Long-Read Technologies

**Problem with NGS (2nd gen)**:

- Short reads (100-300 bp)

- Hard to assemble repetitive regions

- Miss large structural variations

**Solution**: Third-generation sequencing!

### PacBio (Pacific Biosciences)

**Key feature**: Very long reads (10,000-100,000+ bp)

**How it works**:

- Single molecule sequencing

- Watch DNA polymerase add nucleotides in real-time

- Each nucleotide fluoresces

- Incredible! Like watching a molecular movie!

**Advantages**:

- Long reads span difficult regions

- Can sequence through repetitive DNA

- Detects DNA modifications directly

**Disadvantages**:

- Higher error rate (but getting better!)

- More expensive

- Lower throughput

### Oxford Nanopore

**Key feature**: Extremely long reads (up to 2 million bp!)

**How it works**:

**The revolutionary principle**: Instead of detecting fluorescence, Oxford Nanopore measures **changes in electrical current**!

**Step-by-step**:

1. **The nanopore**: A tiny protein pore embedded in a membrane
   - Think of it like a donut hole that DNA passes through
   - Maintains an electrical current flowing through it

2. **DNA threading**: Single-stranded DNA is pulled through the pore
   - Motor protein controls speed
   - DNA passes through one base at a time

3. **Current disruption**: Each base (A, T, G, C) blocks current differently
   - Each base has a unique electrical signature
   - Computer records current changes in real-time
   - Pattern of disruptions reveals the sequence!

4. **No amplification needed**: Sequences single DNA molecules directly
   - **No PCR required** (unlike Illumina!)
   - Avoids PCR errors and biases
   - Detects DNA modifications directly (methylation, etc.)

**Key advantages of no PCR**:

- Faster workflow (skip amplification step)
- More accurate (no PCR duplication errors)
- Detects epigenetic modifications
- Lower sample requirements

**Device features**:

- **Portable**: USB stick size (MinION device)
- **Real-time sequencing**: Watch sequences appear live!
- **Direct RNA sequencing**: Can sequence RNA without converting to DNA first

**Advantages**:

- **Longest reads available**: Regular reads >10 kb, ultra-long reads >100 kb, record >2 Mb!
- **Portable**: Used in field research, remote locations, even the International Space Station!
- **Real-time results**: No need to wait for run to finish
- **Direct RNA sequencing**: Preserves modifications, no reverse transcription needed
- **No amplification bias**: Sequences original molecules
- **Epigenetic detection**: Detects methylation and other modifications directly

**Disadvantages**:

- **Higher error rate**: ~92-95% accuracy (vs. 99%+ for Illumina)
  - But improving rapidly with better algorithms
  - Errors are random, not systematic
  - Can be corrected with higher coverage

- **More expensive per base**: Still more costly than Illumina for high coverage

- **Newer technology**: Still improving (algorithms, chemistry, accuracy)

**Applications where Nanopore excels**:

- **Structural variants**: Long reads easily span deletions, insertions, inversions
- **Repetitive regions**: Can read through repeats that confuse short reads
- **Transcript isoforms**: Full-length RNA sequencing reveals splice variants
- **Metagenomics**: Long reads better for species identification
- **Rapid diagnostics**: Real-time results for outbreak response
- **Field work**: Portable sequencing where labs don't exist!

### Why Long Reads Matter
