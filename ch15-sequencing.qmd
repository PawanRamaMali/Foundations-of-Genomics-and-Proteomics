# Sequencing Technologies

## Reading the Book of Life

### What Is DNA Sequencing?

**DNA sequencing** = Reading the order of A, T, G, and C letters in DNA

Think of it like:
- Reading the text in a book, letter by letter
- Decoding a secret message
- Reading the instruction manual of life!

## From Sanger to Next-Generation Sequencing

### The First Method: Sanger Sequencing (1977)

**Developed by**: Frederick Sanger (won his 2nd Nobel Prize for this!) [@sanger1977dna]

**How it works (simplified)**:

1. Start with DNA template
2. Add special labeled nucleotides that STOP copying when incorporated
3. Create DNA fragments of different lengths
4. Separate fragments by size
5. Read the sequence from the pattern!

**Characteristics**:

- **Accurate**: 99.99% accuracy!
- **Slow**: One sequence at a time
- **Expensive**: Cost millions for whole genomes
- **Read length**: Up to ~1,000 base pairs per read

**Impact**:

- Used for the Human Genome Project!
- Still used today for small-scale sequencing
- Gold standard for accuracy

**The Human Genome Project timeline**:

- **Started**: 1990
- **Finished**: 2003
- **Cost**: $3 billion
- **Time**: 13 years
- **Method**: Sanger sequencing

That's $1 per base pair!

### Sanger Sequencing: The Detailed Mechanism

#### The Biological Foundation

Sanger sequencing is based on **semi-conservative DNA replication** - the same process cells use to copy DNA.

**What is semi-conservative replication?**

Think of DNA like a zipper with two sides:

- One side stays (the template)
- One new side is built (the copy)
- The old side guides making the new side

**Key facts**:

- DNA replication needs a template strand
- One strand serves as the template (parent)
- A new strand is built matching the template (daughter)
- Watson and Crick predicted this in 1953
- Meselson-Stahl proved it in 1958

#### Why DNA Polymerase Needs a Primer

This is an important question! Here's the simple answer:

**The problem**:

- **RNA polymerase** → Can start making RNA from nothing
- **DNA polymerase** → Cannot start from nothing, needs a primer first

**Why the difference?**

Think of it like starting a zipper:

- RNA polymerase is like a self-starting zipper
- DNA polymerase is like a zipper that needs the first tooth in place

**Three reasons DNA polymerase needs a primer**:

**Reason 1: Error checking**

- DNA polymerase checks each base it adds (proofreading)
- It needs something to hold onto to check properly
- Like needing a ruler to measure accurately
- RNA polymerase doesn't check as carefully (RNA is temporary anyway)

**Reason 2: Chemical differences**

- RNA polymerase uses NTPs (have an extra -OH group)
- DNA polymerase uses dNTPs (missing that -OH group)
- That extra -OH helps start from nothing
- DNA polymerase lost this ability during evolution

**Reason 3: Accuracy matters**

- DNA is permanent → needs to be perfect
- Primer gives DNA polymerase a stable starting point
- Like building a house - you need a foundation first
- This reduces copying errors

**Why this matters**:

- **PCR** → Needs primers to work
- **Sanger sequencing** → Needs primers to work
- **Cell DNA replication** → Uses RNA primers (made by primase enzyme)

### The Chemistry of Sanger Sequencing

#### The Special Ingredients

Sanger sequencing uses TWO types of building blocks:

**1. Normal dNTPs (regular DNA building blocks)**:

- **What they are**: dATP, dTTP, dGTP, dCTP
- **What they do**: Build DNA normally
- **Key feature**: Have a 3'-OH group
- **Result**: DNA chain keeps growing

**2. Special ddNTPs (chain terminators)**:

- **What they are**: ddATP, ddTTP, ddGTP, ddCTP
- **What they do**: STOP DNA growth when added
- **Key feature**: MISSING the 3'-OH group
- **Result**: DNA chain stops immediately
- **Bonus**: Each is labeled with a different fluorescent color
  - ddA = Green
  - ddT = Red
  - ddG = Yellow
  - ddC = Blue

#### The Simple Difference

**Normal dNTP** (keeps going):
```
Has -OH group → Next base can attach → Chain grows
```

**Special ddNTP** (stops):
```
NO -OH group → Next base CANNOT attach → Chain stops
```

Think of it like:
- Normal dNTP = Lego brick with connectors on top
- Special ddNTP = Lego brick with flat top (nothing can attach)

#### How Sanger Sequencing Works (Step by Step)

Let's sequence this DNA: `5'-TACGGCATGCTA-3'`

**Step 1: Add primer**

The primer tells DNA polymerase where to start:
```
Template DNA: 5'---TACGGCATGCTA---3'
Primer:            3'-ATGC-5'
                       ↑
                  Start here!
```

**Step 2: Add the mixture**

We add:
- **LOTS** of normal dNTPs (A, T, G, C)
- **A FEW** special ddNTPs (ddA, ddT, ddG, ddC) with colors

**Step 3: DNA polymerase starts copying**

Sometimes it adds a normal base → keeps going
Sometimes it adds a special colored base → STOPS

This creates fragments of different lengths:
```
Fragment 1: 3'-ATGCCGddT-5'      (Stopped at position 7, RED)
Fragment 2: 3'-ATGCCGTAddC-5'    (Stopped at position 8, BLUE)
Fragment 3: 3'-ATGCCGTACddG-5'   (Stopped at position 9, YELLOW)
Fragment 4: 3'-ATGCCGTACGddA-5'  (Stopped at position 10, GREEN)
Fragment 5: 3'-ATGCCGTACGAddT-5' (Stopped at position 11, RED)
```

Each fragment ends with a colored base!

**Step 4: Separate by size**

- Pour fragments through a thin tube
- Small fragments run fast → detected first
- Large fragments run slow → detected last
- Like a race where smaller runners are faster

**Step 5: Read the colors**

Camera sees colors in order:
```
Position 7:  RED    → T was added
Position 8:  BLUE   → C was added
Position 9:  YELLOW → G was added
Position 10: GREEN  → A was added
Position 11: RED    → T was added

Sequence = TCGAT...
```

Done! We just read the DNA sequence!

### Modern Sanger Sequencing Protocol

**Workflow**:

**Step 1: PCR Amplification** (optional but common):
- Amplify target region
- Purify PCR product
- Ensures enough template

**Step 2: Sequencing Reaction**:
- Mix template DNA + sequencing primer
- Add DNA polymerase (thermostable, e.g., Taq)
- Add mix of dNTPs and fluorescent-labeled ddNTPs
- Thermal cycling (like PCR, but linear amplification)

**Typical mix ratio**:
- dNTPs:ddNTPs = ~100:1
- Ensures most reactions continue
- But some terminate at each position

**Step 3: Cleanup**:
- Remove excess ddNTPs
- Remove salts (interfere with electrophoresis)
- Use spin columns or magnetic beads

**Step 4: Capillary Electrophoresis**:
- Inject sample into capillary
- Apply electric field
- Fragments separate by size
- Laser excites fluorophores
- Camera detects emission

**Step 5: Data Analysis**:
- Software converts peaks to sequence
- Quality scores assigned to each base
- Generate chromatogram (peak visualization)

### Reading a Sanger Chromatogram

**What you see**:
```
      A    G    C    T    A    G    C    T
      |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |
     Peak Peak Peak Peak Peak Peak Peak Peak
```

**Quality indicators**:

**Good quality**:
- Sharp, well-separated peaks
- Single color at each position
- Uniform peak height
- High signal-to-noise ratio

**Poor quality**:
- Overlapping peaks (multiple colors)
- Broad peaks
- Low peak height
- Often at start (primer) or end (long reads) of sequence

**Phred quality score**:
- Q20 = 99% accuracy (1 error in 100 bases)
- Q30 = 99.9% accuracy (1 error in 1,000 bases)
- Most modern Sanger reads Q30 for first 700-800 bp

### Semi-Conservative Replication Revisited

**Meselson-Stahl Experiment (1958)** proved semi-conservative replication:

**Experiment**:
1. Grow E. coli in heavy nitrogen (¹⁵N) medium
2. DNA becomes "heavy" (labeled)
3. Switch to normal nitrogen (¹⁴N) medium
4. After one replication: DNA is "hybrid" (one heavy, one light strand)
5. After two replications: Half hybrid, half light

**Result**: Proved DNA replicates semi-conservatively
- One template strand conserved
- One new strand synthesized

**This principle underlies**:
- All DNA replication in cells
- PCR amplification
- Sanger sequencing
- All DNA synthesis!

**Connection to Sanger sequencing**:
- Template strand = original DNA
- Newly synthesized strand = sequence read
- ddNTPs terminate synthesis at random positions
- Pattern reveals template sequence

### Why Semi-Conservative Replication Matters for Sequencing

**Advantages**:
1. **Accuracy**: Template strand provides perfect guide
2. **Complementarity**: A pairs with T, G pairs with C
3. **Proofreading**: DNA polymerase checks each base
4. **Reliability**: Same template gives same sequence

**Fidelity**:
- DNA polymerase error rate: ~1 in 10⁷ (with proofreading)
- Sanger sequencing error rate: ~1 in 10⁴ (due to termination randomness)
- Still extremely accurate!

### Sanger Sequencing Applications Today

**Despite NGS dominance, Sanger still used for**:

**1. Variant Validation**:
- NGS finds potential mutation
- Sanger confirms it
- Gold standard for clinical diagnostics

**2. Small-Scale Projects**:
- Sequencing few genes
- Checking clones
- Verifying plasmids
- More cost-effective than NGS setup

**3. Long Reads**:
- Up to 1,000 bp in single read
- NGS reads much shorter (typically 150-300 bp)
- Useful for spanning repetitive regions

**4. Low-Throughput Needs**:
- 1-96 samples at a time
- Don't need millions of reads
- Academic labs, clinical labs

### Limitations of Sanger Sequencing

**Compared to NGS**:
- **Throughput**: Only 96 samples/run vs. millions in NGS
- **Cost**: $5-10 per reaction vs. $0.01 per Mb for NGS
- **Speed**: Hours per sample vs. days for whole genome (but millions of sequences!)
- **Scalability**: Cannot do whole genomes economically

**When NOT to use Sanger**:
