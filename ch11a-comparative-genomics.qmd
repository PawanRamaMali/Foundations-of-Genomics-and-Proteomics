# Comparative Genomics and Evolution

## Comparing Genomes to Understand Life

### What Is Comparative Genomics?

**Comparative genomics** = Comparing genomes from different species to understand:

- How we're related

- How we evolved

- What makes each species unique

- Which genes are important

Think of it like:

- Comparing different recipes to see what's essential

- Looking at different car models to understand basic car design

- Studying different languages to find common roots

## Why Compare Genomes?

### What We Learn

**1. Evolutionary Relationships**

- Which species are closely related?

- When did species diverge?

- How did we evolve from common ancestors?

**2. Gene Function**

- Genes conserved across species are probably important!

- If mice and humans share a gene, it must be essential

- Can study gene function in simple organisms

**3. Human Health**

- Understand genetic diseases

- Why some species don't get certain diseases

- Identify drug targets

**4. Conservation**

- Genetic diversity in endangered species

- Evolutionary distinctiveness

- Guide conservation efforts

## The Tree of Life

### All Life Is Related

**The amazing truth**: Every living thing shares a common ancestor!

**Evidence from genomes**:

- All life uses DNA (except some viruses use RNA)

- All use the same genetic code (mostly)

- All share some genes

**Three domains of life**:

1. **Bacteria** - Prokaryotes (no nucleus)

2. **Archaea** - Prokaryotes (extremophiles)

3. **Eukarya** - Eukaryotes (nucleus)

### How Close Are We Related?

**Genome similarity to humans**:

| Species | % DNA Similar | Relationship |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| **Chimpanzees** | 96-98% | Closest living relatives |
| **Bonobos** | 96-98% | Also very close |
| **Gorillas** | 95-98% | Great apes |
| **Orangutans** | 94-97% | Great apes |
| **Mice** | ~90% | Common mammal ancestor ~75M years ago |
| **Dogs** | ~84% | Mammals |
| **Chickens** | ~65% | Common ancestor ~300M years ago |
| **Zebrafish** | ~70% | Vertebrates |
| **Fruit flies** | ~60% | Basic animal biology |
| **C. elegans (worm)** | ~38% | Basic genes |
| **Yeast** | ~23% | Basic cellular functions |
| **Bananas** | ~50%* | Basic life processes |
| **E. coli (bacteria)** | ~7%* | Universal genes |

*Shared genes, not overall DNA similarity

### What the Numbers Mean

**High similarity doesn't mean we're the same!**

- That small % difference creates huge changes

- Gene regulation matters as much as genes themselves

- Timing and location of gene expression crucial

**Example - Humans vs Chimpanzees**:

- 98% similar genomes

- But very different!

- Differences in:

  - Brain size and structure

  - Language ability

  - Bipedal walking

  - Reduced body hair

  - Longer lifespan

## Conserved Genes and Sequences

### What's Been Preserved Through Evolution?

**Conserved sequences** = DNA/protein sequences that haven't changed much over millions of years

**Why conserve?**

- If it works, don't change it!

- Changes would be harmful

- Under "purifying selection" (bad changes eliminated)

### Highly Conserved Genes

**Housekeeping genes**:

- Needed by all cells

- Basic cellular functions

- DNA replication, transcription, translation

- Energy production

**Example - Histones**:

- DNA packaging proteins

- Nearly identical from yeast to humans

- Changed very little in 1 billion years!

**Example - Ribosomal RNA**:

- Used to build ribosomes

- Extremely conserved

- Used to construct tree of life!

### Ultraconserved Elements

**Ultraconserved elements** = DNA sequences 100% identical across species

**Mind-blowing fact**:

- Some sequences are EXACTLY the same in humans, mice, rats

- Over 200 base pairs long

- Separated by ~75 million years of evolution

- Must be VERY important!

**What do they do?**

- Many are enhancers (regulate genes)

- Control development

- We're still figuring it out!

## Synteny: Gene Order Conservation

### Genes Stay Together

**Synteny** = Genes located in the same order on chromosomes across species

**Example**:

- Human chromosome 1 has genes A-B-C-D-E

- Mouse chromosome 2 might have genes A-B-C-D-E in same order

- Shows common ancestry!

**Why it matters**:

- Helps identify corresponding genes across species

- Understanding chromosome evolution

- Clues about gene function

**Exceptions**:

- Chromosomal rearrangements happen

- Inversions, translocations

- Create differences between species

## Molecular Clocks

### Dating Evolution with DNA

**Molecular clock** = Using mutation rate to estimate when species diverged

**The concept**:

- Mutations accumulate over time

- At roughly constant rate

- More differences = longer time since common ancestor

**How it works**:

1. Compare DNA sequences between two species

2. Count differences

3. Know mutation rate

4. Calculate time since divergence

**Example**:

- Humans and chimps differ by ~35 million base pairs

- Mutation rate ~ 1 change per billion bases per year

- Estimate divergence: 5-7 million years ago

- Matches fossil evidence!

### Calibrating the Clock

**Problems**:

- Mutation rates aren't perfectly constant

- Vary between species

- Vary across genome

**Solution**:

- Use fossil evidence to calibrate

- Known divergence dates from fossils

- Adjust molecular clock accordingly

## Gene Families and Evolution

### Genes Evolve by Duplication

**Gene families** = Groups of related genes from a common ancestor

**How they form**:

1. Gene duplicates (DNA copying error)

2. Now two copies of same gene

3. One copy can mutate freely

4. Diverge to perform new or specialized functions

### Types of Gene Relationships

**Orthologs**:

- Same gene in different species

- Separated by speciation

- Usually same function

- Example: Human insulin vs. mouse insulin

**Paralogs**:

- Related genes within same genome

- Separated by duplication

- Often different functions

- Example: α-globin vs. β-globin (both in hemoglobin)

### Example: Globin Gene Family

**The story**:

- Ancient globin gene

- Duplicated many times

- Diverged into specialized forms

- Myoglobin (stores oxygen in muscle)

- Hemoglobin α and β chains (transport oxygen in blood)

- Fetal hemoglobin (binds oxygen better than adult form)

**Cool fact**: All from one ancestral gene!

## What Makes Humans Human?

### The 2% Difference

Humans and chimps share 98% of DNA. What accounts for the 2%?

**Key differences**:

**1. FOXP2 Gene**:

- Transcription factor

- Important for language and speech

- Humans have 2 amino acid changes vs. chimps

- Linked to speech development

**2. HAR1 (Human Accelerated Region 1)**:

- Rapidly evolved in humans

- Involved in brain development

- Controls cortex formation

- Only 18 changes but huge impact!

**3. Gene Regulation Changes**:

- Not just which genes, but WHEN and WHERE

- Brain genes expressed more in humans

- Different expression patterns during development

**4. Copy Number Variations**:

- Humans have more copies of some genes

- Salivary amylase (digests starch) - varies by diet

- Brain development genes - duplications

**5. Lost Genes**:

- Humans LOST some genes chimps have

- Loss of jaw muscle gene → bigger brain case

- Loss of spine genes → smoother skin

## Evo-Devo: Evolution Meets Development

### How Body Plans Evolve

**Evo-Devo** = Evolutionary developmental biology

**Key insight**: Changes in development genes create new body forms

**Hox Genes Across Animals**:

- ALL animals have Hox genes!

- Control body plan (head to tail)

- Same genes in flies, fish, mice, humans

- Different regulation = different bodies

**Example - Snakes**:

- Have Hox genes like mice

- But expressed differently

- Extended body region

- No limbs (limb genes repressed)

**Example - Giraffe Neck**:

- Same number of neck bones as mice (7)

- But each vertebra is much longer

- Changed growth regulation, not genes themselves!

## Genomic Islands and Hotspots

### Regions of Rapid Evolution

**Genomic islands**:

- Regions that evolve faster than average

- Often involved in adaptation

- Species-specific traits

**Examples**:

- Immune system genes (pathogen arms race)

- Sensory genes (different environments)

- Reproductive genes (sexual selection)

## Ancient DNA and Extinct Species

### Learning from the Past

**Paleogenomics** = Sequencing DNA from extinct species

**Success stories**:

**1. Neanderthals**:

- Sequenced whole genome

- Interbred with humans

- 1-4% of non-African human DNA is Neanderthal

- Contributed immunity genes

**2. Denisovans**:

- Known only from DNA (and few bones)

- Interbred with humans

- Contributed high-altitude adaptation genes (Tibetans)

**3. Woolly Mammoths**:

- Sequenced from frozen specimens

- Understanding adaptation to cold

- De-extinction efforts underway!

**4. Ancient Humans**:

- Track human migrations out of Africa

- Understand population history

- Admixture events

## Horizontal Gene Transfer

### Genes Jump Between Species!

**Horizontal gene transfer (HGT)** = Genes transferred between species (not parent to offspring)

**Common in bacteria**:

- Antibiotic resistance genes spread this way

- Public health concern!

**Also in eukaryotes**:

- Bdelloid rotifers: 8% of genes from bacteria, fungi, plants!

- Aphids: Got bacterial genes for making pigments

- Tardigrades: Extreme survival partly from borrowed genes

**Implications**:

- Tree of life is more like a web

- Evolution more complex than thought

- Challenges traditional classification
