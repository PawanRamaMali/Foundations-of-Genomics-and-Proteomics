# Mitochondrial and Organelle Genomes

## Genomes Within Genomes

### A Surprising Discovery

Here's something amazing: You don't just have ONE genome! You actually have multiple genomes inside your cells!

**Your genomes**:

1. **Nuclear genome** - In the nucleus (the main one we've been talking about)

2. **Mitochondrial genome** - In mitochondria (tiny power plants)

3. **Chloroplast genome** - In chloroplasts (if you're a plantâ€”sorry, you're not! ðŸŒ±)

Think of it like:

- Your cell is a factory

- The factory has a main office with blueprints (nuclear genome)

- But the power plant and solar panels have their own instruction manuals too!

## The Endosymbiotic Theory

### How Did This Happen?

Why do mitochondria have their own DNA? The answer is one of biology's coolest stories!

### The Big Idea

The **endosymbiotic theory** explains that:

- Billions of years ago, one cell swallowed another cell

- Instead of digesting it, they formed a partnership

- The swallowed cell became mitochondria (and chloroplasts in plants)

- This partnership was so successful that it became permanent!

**"Endosymbiotic" means**:

- **Endo** = inside

- **Symbiotic** = living together (mutually beneficial)

- So: "living together inside"

### The Story: How It Probably Happened

**About 2 billion years ago**:

1. **A big cell** (early eukaryote) is swimming around

2. **A small bacterium** (that's good at making energy) is nearby

3. **The big cell engulfs the bacterium** (like eating it)

4. **But doesn't digest it!** (Maybe it couldn't, or maybe the bacterium was protected)

5. **The bacterium survives inside** and keeps making energy

6. **Win-win situation**:

   - Bacterium gets protection and food

   - Big cell gets lots of energy (ATP)

7. **They become dependent on each other**

8. **Over millions of years**, the bacterium becomes mitochondria!

Think of it like:

- You hire a chef to live in your house

- They make all your meals

- Eventually, they become part of the family

- Now you can't imagine life without them!

### Evidence for Endosymbiotic Theory

How do we know this actually happened? Lots of evidence!

**1. Mitochondria have their own DNA**

- Separate from nuclear DNA

- More similar to bacterial DNA than eukaryotic DNA

- Circular, like bacterial chromosomes!

**2. Mitochondria have double membranes**

- Inner membrane: From the original bacterium

- Outer membrane: From when it was engulfed

- Like a bag inside a bag!

**3. Mitochondria are the same size as bacteria**

- About 1-2 micrometers

- Perfect size match!

**4. Mitochondria divide independently**

- They reproduce by splitting (binary fission)

- Just like bacteria!

- Not controlled by the nucleus

**5. Mitochondrial ribosomes are like bacterial ribosomes**

- Different from cytoplasmic ribosomes

- Similar size and structure to bacterial ribosomes

**6. Some antibiotics affect mitochondria**

- Antibiotics that target bacteria also affect mitochondria

- Because mitochondria are basically modified bacteria!

**7. DNA comparisons show mitochondria are related to specific bacteria**

- Most closely related to **alpha-proteobacteria**

- Like finding a long-lost cousin!

### Who Discovered This?

**Lynn Margulis** (1938-2011):

- Proposed the endosymbiotic theory in 1967

- Most scientists didn't believe her at first!

- Kept collecting evidence

- Eventually proved she was right

- Now her theory is accepted by all scientists

Her story teaches us: Good science and persistence can change our understanding of life!

## The Human Mitochondrial Genome

### Basic Facts

**Size**: Only about 16,500 base pairs

- Compare to nuclear genome: 3.2 billion base pairs

- That's **200,000 times smaller**!

**Shape**: Circular (like bacteria!)

- Nuclear DNA: Linear chromosomes

- Mitochondrial DNA: One circular chromosome

**Location**: Inside mitochondria (in the cytoplasm, outside the nucleus)

**How many copies**:

- Each mitochondrion has 2-10 copies of its genome

- Each cell has hundreds to thousands of mitochondria

- So each cell has thousands of copies of the mitochondrial genome!

Think of it like:

- Nuclear genome: One master copy in a safe

- Mitochondrial genome: Thousands of backup copies everywhere!

### Organization

The mitochondrial genome is VERY compact:

- **37 genes total** (compared to ~20,000 nuclear genes)

- **No introns** (like bacterial genes!)

- **Very little non-coding DNA** (super efficient)

- **Some genes overlap!** (to save space)

It's like a perfectly optimized, minimalist instruction manual!

### What Genes Does It Have?

The 37 mitochondrial genes include:

**13 genes for proteins**:

- All involved in making energy (ATP)

- Part of the electron transport chain

- Essential for cellular respiration

**22 genes for tRNAs**:

- Transfer RNAs needed for making proteins inside mitochondria

**2 genes for rRNAs**:

- Ribosomal RNAs needed for mitochondrial ribosomes

**That's it!** Only 37 genes!

### What Happened to the Other Genes?

Mitochondria used to be bacteria with thousands of genes. Where did they go?

**Three fates**:

1. **Moved to the nucleus** (most genes)

   - Over time, genes transferred from mitochondria to nucleus

   - Now encoded in nuclear DNA

   - Proteins made in cytoplasm, then imported to mitochondria

2. **Lost completely** (genes no longer needed)

   - Living inside a cell, mitochondria didn't need some genes anymore

   - Like getting rid of camping gear when you move into a house

3. **Stayed in mitochondria** (essential genes)

   - The 37 genes that are still there

   - Probably stayed because they're needed immediately in mitochondria

Think of it like:

- A company outsourcing most tasks to headquarters (nucleus)

- Keeping only the most essential operations in-house (mitochondria)

## Inheritance of Mitochondrial DNA

### You Got It From Your Mom!

Here's something special: **You inherit mitochondrial DNA only from your mother!**

**Why?**

- Egg cells have lots of mitochondria (thousands!)

- Sperm cells have very few mitochondria (in the tail)

- When sperm fertilizes egg, usually only the sperm nucleus enters

- Even if some sperm mitochondria enter, they're quickly destroyed

- So all your mitochondria come from the egg (mom)!

Think of it like:

- Mom provides the house and all the furniture (mitochondria)

- Dad just brings his suitcase (nucleus)

### Implications

**Maternal inheritance means**:

- You share mitochondrial DNA with your mom, her mom, her mom's mom, etc.

- All the way back through your maternal line

- Your siblings have the same mitochondrial DNA

- But your dad's mitochondrial DNA wasn't passed to you

**Uses**:

- **Tracing maternal ancestry**: Tracking maternal lineages through history

- **"Mitochondrial Eve"**: The most recent common maternal ancestor of all humans (~150,000 years ago)

- **Family relationships**: Confirming maternal relatives

## Functions of Mitochondrial DNA Genes

### Why Are These Genes So Important?

The 13 protein-coding genes in mitochondrial DNA are all involved in one crucial process: **Making ATP (cellular energy)**!

### The Electron Transport Chain

Mitochondria make ATP using a complex of proteins called the **electron transport chain**.

Think of it like:

- A series of machines in a factory

- Passing electrons from one to the next

- Using the energy to make ATP (cellular energy)

**The 13 mitochondrial genes encode**:

- 7 subunits of Complex I

- 1 subunit of Complex III

- 3 subunits of Complex IV

- 2 subunits of Complex V (ATP synthase)

**But wait!** The electron transport chain has many more proteins than 13!

**The rest come from nuclear genes**:

- Made in the cytoplasm

- Imported into mitochondria

- Assembled with the mitochondrial-encoded proteins

It's a team effort! Nuclear and mitochondrial genomes work together!

### Why Keep Genes in Mitochondria?

Scientists wondered: Why keep any genes in mitochondria? Why not move them all to the nucleus?

**Possible reasons**:

1. **Rapid response**: Genes in mitochondria can respond quickly to energy needs

2. **High expression needed**: These genes need to be made in huge amounts

3. **Hydrophobic proteins**: Some proteins are too "water-hating" to cross membranes easily

4. **Gene regulation**: Keeping them local allows better control

5. **Redox regulation**: Some proteins need to be made near reactive oxygen species

## Mitochondrial Diseases

### When Mitochondrial DNA Goes Wrong

Mutations in mitochondrial DNA can cause diseases:

**Characteristics of mitochondrial diseases**:

- Affect high-energy organs most (brain, muscle, heart)

- Maternal inheritance (passed from mom)

- Variable severity (depends on ratio of mutant to normal mitochondria)

- Can appear at any age

**Examples**:

- **MELAS**: Stroke-like episodes, seizures

- **LHON**: Vision loss

- **Leigh syndrome**: Neurological problems

**Why variable severity?**

- Cells have thousands of mitochondria

- Some might have mutant DNA, some normal DNA

- Ratio determines severity

- Different tissues can have different ratios!

This is called **heteroplasmy** (mixed population of mitochondrial DNA).

## Chloroplasts: The Plant Power Source

### Photosynthesis Factories

Plants (and algae) have another type of organelle with its own genome: **chloroplasts**!

**Chloroplasts**:

- Make food using sunlight (photosynthesis)

- Contain chlorophyll (green pigment)

- Also originated from endosymbiosis!

- Captured from cyanobacteria (photosynthetic bacteria)

### Chloroplast Genome

**Size**: About 120,000-200,000 base pairs

- Larger than mitochondrial genome

- But still much smaller than nuclear genome

**Genes**: About 100-120 genes

- Photosynthesis genes

- Some ribosomal and transfer RNA genes

- Similar to cyanobacteria genes

**Also circular** like mitochondrial DNA and bacteria!

### Double Endosymbiosis?

Plants actually had TWO endosymbiotic events:

1. **First**: Acquired mitochondria (like all eukaryotes)

2. **Second**: Acquired chloroplasts (only in plants and algae)

Some organisms even had a **third** endosymbiotic event (capturing algae that already had chloroplasts)!

It's endosymbiosis all the way down! ðŸŒ€
